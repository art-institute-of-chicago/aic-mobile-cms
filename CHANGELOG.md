Mobile App CMS Changelog
=============================

At the Digital Experience department of the Art Institute of Chicago, we use Redmine as our 
internal issue tracker. Some of the changes listed here reference issues tracked via Redmine. 
In order to differentiate between references to GitHub issues and Redmine issues, we are 
adopting the following scheme:

```
* Change description (#14) [#23]

(#14) = reference to a GitHub issue
[#23] = reference to a Redmine issue
```

Outside contributors can ignore Redmine references.
