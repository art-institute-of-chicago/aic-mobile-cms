America Windows,150.mp3,"""Narrator:  These luminous blue stained glass panels were made in 1977 by Marc Chagall. Stephanie D’Alessandro, Gary C. and Frances Comer, Curator of Modern Art. 
Stephanie D’Alessandro:  The Chagall windows were given to the Art Institute in 1977 to commemorate the American bicentennial and the tenure of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley who died in 1976. They are called “America Windows”. For Chagall, a Jewish artist born in Russia born in Russia, the American bicentennial was very important. As a result of antisemitism in his homeland Chagall was denied the opportunities that were available to other artists. He moved to France where he would spend most of his life except for a short period during the 1940s when Nazi persecution forced him to flee to the United States. “America Windows” celebrates the aspect of American life that Chagall most admired during his time here, its social and artistic freedom. Divided into six panels, each part of the window is dedicated to a particular theme. Beginning on the left the first panel is devoted to music. In it you’ll see violins, the musical score and a musician blowing a horn. Panel two celebrates fine art with a palette, canvas and still life arrangement. The third panel recognizes the Declaration of Independence which lies on the desk and literature more generally. “America Windows” fourth panel further celebrates the spirit of liberty with images of an eagle and the Statue of Liberty, as well as the American achievements of the great city and skyscraper represented here by the Chicago skyline. Panel five is dedicated to drama and shows a harlequin extending his mask to an actor who wears an elaborate costume. The last panel honors dance with three folk performers. Just below them and floating among the other figures is a goat, an image Chagall frequently used to insert himself symbolically into his work and by extension into this joyful celebration of American liberty and creativity

Statue of Young Dionysos,171.mp3,"""Narrator:  This large scale bronze dating from about the first century B.C. to the first century A.D. depicts Dionysus the god of wine and theater who was worshiped widely throughout the Mediterranean. This statue was probably made in the area of present day Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and Semele, a mortal, Dionysius was in Roman times often portrayed as he is here as an adolescent youth. His lips may have originally been wrought from copper and his flowing locks of hair echo a style often worn by athletes or gods. It’s bound by a thin headband and a twisted grapevine which once may have had leaves and grapes. His gently curled right hand probably cradled a bunch of grapes or a kantharos, a long handled wine cup. His left hand would have held a thyrsus, a staff topped with a pinecone that was associated with the worship of Dionysus. In Greek vase painting and Roman sculpture, Dionysus is usually shown surrounded by satyrs, half-human half-beast and a retinue of female followers. In his role as the god of theater, his followers were known for staging elaborate festivals marked by drinking, dancing and feasting, the extreme of which left participants in a trance like state of ekstasis, the origin of the English word ecstasy. To this day, the adjective Dionysian describes unbridled celebration and excess. To hear more about how the statue was assembled, press play."""
King Vulture,201.mp3,"""Narrator:  This magnificent king vulture is powerfully modeled from the feathers of its sweeping wings to its sharp cool claws. It perches on a tree stump whose white glaze is a perfect foil to its strong coloring. The vulture was made in 1734 at the famous Meissen porcelain factory near Dresden in Germany. Founded in 1710 under the patronage of King Augustus the Strong, ruler of Saxony, Meissen was the first European factory to discover how to make hard paste porcelain. This material previously only had been made in China and since the seventeenth century in Japan. August the Strong was Meissen’s foremost client. A passionate lover of art and architecture, Augustus commissioned porcelain sculptures of the birds and animals of the world. Curator Ghenete Zelleke. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  One of its great sculptors, a man by the name of Johann Joachim Kändler was set to work on creating an aviary and menagerie of birds and animals in porcelain. Augustus the Strong had a king vulture in his aviary in Dresden and there are records for Kändler drawing this from life. So I think he really was able to infuse this bird, this sculpture with the essence of its life."""
Teapot,202.mp3,"""Narrator:  Curator Ghenete Zelleke. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  This is a particularly exquisite example of a tea service for two. It was made in the first years of the eighteenth century at a time when tea was becoming increasingly popular in Europe. And tea had long been an import from China and as such was particularly expensive. Here you have the most magnificent teapot in that it is made of silver gilt and then is further ornamented with these brilliant panels of enamel colors painted with narrative scenes. 
Narrator:  The cups and saucers decorations symbolizes the four elements. The saucer to the left represents water with Neptune classical god of the sea. Its cup features fire in the furnace of Vulcan blacksmith to the gods. The other saucer depicts the goddess Cybele presented with the earth’s bounty. And on its cup air is personified by Juno, queen of the gods with her peacock. The teapot itself shows the shepherd Paris presenting the golden apple to Venus whom he has chosen as the most beautiful of the goddesses. This narrative includes the character shown on the cups and saucers linking the different parts of this magnificent tea set with a common theme."""
"Clock Case and ""Onion"" Watch with Leather Case",203.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Small intricately modeled clocks were among the most difficult forms to create in porcelain. This piece was made in 1725 by the du Paquier porcelain manufactory in Vienna, Austria. It is actually a case made to hold the large onion watch which you see displayed next to it. The clock case has strong connections with domestic design. Curator Ghenete Zelleke. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  This clock in its structure and overall decoration very much resembles the large ovens that would have been set in the corners of aristocratic rooms to heat the rooms in the winter. And the modeler basically took that form and reduced it to make this tower like clock case. The decoration that you see on the clock particularly that of the eagle standing on a globe and then the profile of a man looking right all have to do with the Hapsburgs who were the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire at this time of which Vienna was the capital city. 
Narrator:  The profile is that of that of the Emperor Charles VI who gave the du Paquier manufactory an exclusive patent to produce fine porcelain in 1718."""
Tureen,204.mp3,"""Narrator:  All of the objects in this case were made at the du Paquier porcelain manufactory established in Vienna, Austria in 1718. The manufactory’s founder Claudius du Paquier wanted to capitalize on the new demand for European hard paste porcelain. Previously, objects made from this luxury material had to be imported from China and more recently Japan. But in the early eighteen century German ceramicists at Meissen finally discovered the secret of making hard paste porcelain. The du Paquier manufactory was only active for twenty-five years but in this time it produced an extraordinary range of porcelains. Chinese influenced designs were extremely popular in Europe at this time. You can see several examples of this style in the case, including this soup tureen. It is painted with overblown peonies and flowering cherry tree branches. Vividly colored birds perch and fly among them. In the long case to the right, you will find other pieces of du Paquier porcelain. These have ornamental borders of scrolling patterns, trellis work and stylized foliage also typical of the elegant du Paquier style."""
Console Table,207.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  In this gallery you will find paintings, sculpture and decorative arts from the seventeenth and eighteenth century France. This extravagantly carved and gilded side table was made in France around 1735. It is richly carved with undulating curves and forms derived from natural sources such as shelves, leaves and branches. This style is known as rococo. It was named after the French word rocaille which described the fanciful rock work used to embellish waterfalls and grottos in aristocratic gardens. Notice also the heads at either end of the table personifying the winds ready to blow a gentle breeze. Originally, the table was likely placed beneath a hanging mirror made in the same style. Curator Ghenete Zelleke. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  Imagine this in candlelight at the end of the day when the light would flicker and be reflected by these many different curves and carvings making it seem almost alive. 
Narrator:  Now, walk over to the large case containing porcelain, press the play button when you are ready to hear more."""
Tureen and Stand,208.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Imagine this magnificent silver tureen set on a dining table in a splendid Paris mansion or chateau in the French countryside. It’s curved surfaces gleaming in the candlelight. It would have been part of a splendid display of tableware including candelabra, lavish serving platters and perhaps tiered stands displaying fruits and sweet meets and exquisitely hand painted porcelain dishes. The tureen is a masterpiece of the silversmith’s art. Look at the babies that hold up its handles on either side. They are wonderfully realized with naturalistic ringlets and curls in their hair and dimpled chubby cheeks and arms. Notice also the tureen stand whose fluted contours reflect light back on to the silver above. The tureen was made in the workshop of François-Thomas Germain, one of the most celebrated silversmiths in France in the mid-eighteenth century. Germain’s patrons included the kings of France and Portugal as well as wealthy aristocrats throughout Europe."""
Londonderry Vase,209.mp3,"""Narrator:  This monumental vase with its lavish decorations was obviously designed to make an unforgettable impact. It was made in 1813 at the celebrated Sèvres porcelain manufactory just outside Paris which produced only a few such large and technically challenging pieces. The vase’s elegantly elongated form is based on agent Roman vessels and its tall handles end and roundels recalling classical medals or coins. Ancient art and imagery especially that of the imperial Roman period was very fashionable at this time especially in France. Lustrous gilding covers the vase’s white porcelain surface making it resemble gilded bronze. It is decorated with exquisitely detailed flowers, foliage and lifelike birds whose feathers almost seem to quiver as they each draw breath. Sèvres painters were especially celebrated for their extraordinary ability to reproduce incredibly detailed imagery on smooth porcelain. Almost all of the Sèvres vases of this size and period were made as important imperial or diplomatic gifts. This one was presented as part of the peace negotiations between France and Britain at the end of the Napoleonic wars. It was given to the British Ambassador Lord Castlereagh by Talleyrand the French Foreign Minister. Castlereagh eventually inherited the title of Marquess of Londonderry and so this magnificent vase has come to be called after his family name."""
Still Life with Ostrich Egg Cup and the Whitfield Heirlooms,211.mp3,"""Narrator:  This elegant cup was made in England in 1590 by a silversmith who worked for Queen Elizabeth I. It’s elaborate silver gilt cover and stem have set off the ivory surface of a most unusual material, an ostrich egg. Thought to be laid by the mythical griffin ostrich eggs were then highly prized and very costly in Europe. The cup belonged to John Whitfield a wealthy London lawyer connected with the royal court. In fact, the cup may have been given to Whitfield by Queen Elizabeth herself, a silver gilt Tudor rose emblem of her family is mounted inside the ostrich egg. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.
Ghenete Zelleke:  What’s doubly interesting about this cup is that it is featured in a painting by the Dutch still life painter Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraten. You see the ostrich cup in amongst a group of other precious objects including a watch, a gold chain, a lacquer box. 
Narrator:  The painting dates from about 1670. It was probably commissioned by John Whitfield’s grandson to commemorate some of this family’s most precious possessions and heirlooms."""
Horse and Rider,212.mp3,"""<horse neighing>
Narrator:  Rising up on its back hooves this powerful horse is controlled by its rider with a dramatic upward flick of the reigns. Notice how the rider’s figure rendered in cool silver is set off against the warm toned gilding of the horse’s body. This juxtaposition is especially dynamic in areas like the horse’s wild mane flowing against the muscular lines of his rider’s arm. This tour de force of the silversmith’s art was made in Southern Germany. It’s theme of horse and rider was a popular and illustrious one recalling ancient Greek and Roman imagery. We can imagine the horse and rider displayed on a multi-tiered sideboard with other precious items at a grand banquet. It might also have served as a ceremonial drinking cup. Look closely at the horse’s neck. There was a line running around it. The head could be lifted off and turned upside down to form a cup. At a banquet the cup could be filled with wine for each desk to drink from in turn. The horse and rider, made in the early seventeenth century, is one of the last examples in the German tradition of ceremonial drinking vessels designed in the form of heraldic mythological and other animals."""
Coffer,213.mp3,"""Narrator:  Jewelry or extremely precious textiles were probably stored inside this lavishly decorated chest. It was made by André Charles Boulle. Boulle’s patrons in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century first included King Louis XIV and many of his courtiers. Curator Ghenete Zelleke. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  Boulle specialized in a type of marquetry that included tortoise shell, brass, pewter and sometimes ebony. And you would lay the design on a piece of paper over a package of thin veneers of tortoise shell, brass, pewter and then cut through his package of veneers with a saw according to the lines in the design. And when you were finished you would have essentially pieces of a puzzle that were reconstructed on the sides of the coffer to create these areas of negative and positive brass or tortoise shell dominating one or the other of the services. 
Narrator:  Elaborate gilt bronze mounts complete the decorative scheme. The central head may represent Apollo the classical sun god. On either sides are cranes heads. Cranes were thought to hold a pebble in one claw which dropped in the water and woke them if they fell asleep. Therefore, they symbolized vigilance. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  And you see how the beaks of the cranes thread into the latches for the lid and they are, in fact, guardians or protectors of the contents of the box."""
Secretary Cabinet,214.mp3,"""Narrator:  Chinese art was all the rage in early eighteenth century England where its imagery was found to combine elegance with a certain air of mysterious exotic charm. Chinese ceramics and wallpapers were avidly collected but a growing market also developed for objects produced in England in the Chinese style. Made around 1735 this desk is entirely English in form with its drawers and bookcase crowned by a broken pediment with classical urns. But its flamboyant decorative scheme clearly draws on Chinese techniques and imagery. Its surface is covered with an English version of glossy red lacquer. Against this background East Asian inspired figures, animals and flora are rendered in tones of silver and gold that would have glowed under candlelight. The large figures of a graceful Chinese lady and gentleman on the inside of the cabinet’s upper doors are especially well preserved. They would usually have been revealed only to the eyes of the cabinet’s owner when seated at the desk or pulling a book from its upper stories."""
Tureen in the form of a Rabbit,215.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This charming porcelain rabbit is a tureen. We can imagine him sitting on an English eighteenth century dining table filled with rabbit stew which could be ladled out once his top half was lifted off. His ears extend out to form a handle which presumably remained conveniently cool to the touch. The rabbit is modeled and decorated with great realism. Notice the hairs of his coat, not only painted on but also molded into his body over his back haunches. He nibbles on a halfly [ph?] finished leaf which is playfully provided with a little snail trying to crawl away. The rabbit was made at the Chelsea porcelain manufactory which was established in London in 1745 by the silversmith Nicholas Sprimont. Sprimont was equally talented in created new table wares with delicate painted imagery as well as fanciful purely decorative figures such as birds, animals, shepherds and shepherdesses. This rabbit bridges both areas in being functional as well as ornamental. Nearby you can see another tureen in the form of a hen.

Center Table,216.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  At first glance, this looks like a console or side table but, in fact, half of its top surface is currently folded down against the wall. When opened up, the table becomes a grand center piece with decorative carving around all four of its sides. It would be impossible to draw in a chair comfortably beneath these carvings. So if this is not a dining table, how might it have been used. A clue is in the rams’ heads carved on each leg. In classical imagery rams are associated with Bacchus, god of wine and festivities. Curator Ghenete Zelleke. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  It probably served as a stage for perhaps elaborate pieces of silver. And I think the details of the carving, for example, the rams’ heads with horns and the pendent grapevines that fall from the mouths of the rams I think that indicates that the table may have been used for ceremonial occasions or banquets that included a sideboard full of silver that related to the drinking of wine. 
Narrator:  The quantity of expensive Cuban mahogany and the grand scale of the table indicate that it would have been an expensive special commission.

Two-Handled Cup and Cover,217.mp3,"""Narrator:  Paul de Lamerie was one of the most talented and prolific silversmiths working in England in the first half of the eighteenth century. He made this ornate two handled covered cup in about 1740 when the rococo style was reaching the height of its popularity in England. Look at the cup’s handles. Each one made from a series of extravagantly curved serpentine forms. These forms are inspired by those seen in nature such as leaves and shells. In fact, the name rococo comes from the French rocaille which describe the rocks and shells that ornamented grottos in fashionably landscaped gardens. Halfway up the cup is a frieze of grinning heads representing followers of Bacchus, god of wine. They refer to the cup’s original purpose. Large two handled cups were traditionally used as communal drinking vessels. The two handles served to facilitate passing the heavy wine filled cup from person to person. They were a staple of all male societies such as colleges, clubs, and guild or trade associations. Later in the eighteenth century these commemorative presentation objects began to be used as sporting prizes."""
Wine Jug,218.mp3,"""Narrator:  Dating from about 1740 this elaborate jug was made by Charles Frederick Kandler a German-born silversmith who lived and worked in London for most of his life. At this time, London’s wealthy merchant class was expanding fast joining the aristocracy in providing a thriving market for luxury goods such as this piece. Kandler drew on classically mythology to create a design fitting to the jug’s purpose. Curator Ghenete Zelleke. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  All of the decorative elements are expressive of the use of this ewer for wine. The finial is in the form of a seated Pan figure blowing his pipes. The spout is in the form of a leopard whose neck is encrusted with grapevines. And the handle is in the form of caryatid female figure who is holding a bunch of grapes above her head about to eat one of them. 
Narrator:  These elements subtlety flatter the wine jug’s owner implying that he had been educated to understand classical references. The jug also features witty details to entertain a drinking party. It’s lower part features putti or classical babies. The central pair tread grapes and raise toasts. Meanwhile, their overindulgent friend sleeps off the effects nearby."""
Table Centerpiece,219.mp3,"""Narrator:  No fashionable 18th Century dining table was without its elegant decorations.  At the highest level of society, these consisted of silver or porcelain or a combination of the two.  A formal dinner of three courses culminated in a spectacular array of sweet meats, often dramatically arranged around special decorations.  These monkey musicians made at the Meissen Porcelain Factor in Germany were dessert ornaments designed to delight the eye as the elaborate sweet meats pleased the palate.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.
Ghenete Zelleke:  So imagine the dessert course of a dinner with this wonderful silver gilt and mirrored plateau and the porcelain figures laid out on the top of them with candlelight flickering and animating the figures as well as reflecting on the mirrored surface.
<music plays>
Ghenete Zelleke:  Now why monkeys dressed as orchestra players?  It was a fashion in France in the early 18th Century for painted rooms and painted paddles with the monkey playing and sometimes dressed in European costume.
Narrator:  These musicians literally ape human activities but despite their fashionable and gentile attire, the monkeys show their hairy legs and sharp teeth with a little too much abandon.  Free from the human obligations of decorous behavior, the monkeys are at liberty to amuse and entertain the dinner guests, whose dessert course they decorated."""
Secretary Cabinet,220.mp3,"""Narrator:  This imposing desk gives us a vivid insight into the poetic view of China seen in 18th Century European decorative arts known as shinwasarri [ph?], Western imagery of this kind was inspired by authentic art imported from Asia.  But interpreted by European artists and craftsmen, China becomes a land of the imagination filled with graceful figures, exotic plants and pavilions.  Here in the central panel above the desk lid, a figure shaded by a parasol walks through a building in picturesque dilapidation.  Notice how the vertical forms of the palm tree above him and the branches on the side panels echo the tall lines of the desk itself.  The desk is the work of David Roentgen.  Roentgen's workshop was in his native Germany but he travelled widely, established a lucrative shop in Paris and was appointed cabinet maker to Queen Mary Antoinette of France shortly after he made this desk.  Roentgen was especially adept at inlay techniques.  We can appreciate his skill in the extraordinary inlaid imagery here such as the fine differentiation of shaded folds in the people's clothing and the delicate curving forms of leaves and grasses."""
Wall Clock,221.mp3,"""Narrator:  This 18th Century clock with its extravagant design and sophisticated interior mechanism would have been extremely expensive.  The case was made by Jean-Pierre Latz who was cabinet maker to King Louis XV of France.  Its mass of intertwining rococo curves incorporating leaves, tendrils and floral garlands is made from gilt bronze.  The clock is surmounted by the figure of Apollo, Classical God of Music and Rationality.  He leans down the slay a winged serpent emerging dramatically from a cavern beneath the clock face.  Under the serpent, the face of Hera, Classical Goddess of Marriage and Childbirth appears, she gives a clue to the reason for the clock's existence.  If you look just above her head, you will see two small coats of arms held by lions, these belong to a Flemish couple whose marriage the clock was probably made to celebrate.  Inside, the clock has an extraordinarily complex eight day movement which could play music as well as tell time."""
Fall-Front Desk,222.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  This massive and lavishly decorated desk was made in Vienna, Austria in about 1812.  Its design includes many elements inspired by classical art.  The central part of the desk with its curved tapering shape recalls a classical lyre.  It is flanked by tall cornucopias which could have been used to display flowers.  Griffin figures, half lion, half eagle support the lower part of the desk and it rests on giant paws as ancient Roman furnishings sometimes did.  The desk's classical elements are a bow to the fashionable French empire style whose influence had spread across Europe by the early 19th Century.  This style was popularized by the Emperor Napoleon I who wanted the forms of Imperial Roman art to cast their august glory on the imagery of his own regime.  But if the desk looks to France for its design, its materials are purely Viennese in their rich variety of exotic veneers, ebonized surfaces, gilding and gilt bronze."""
Chair,223.mp3,"""Narrator:  This English chair was made around 1810 after a design by Thomas Hope.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.
Ghenete Zelleke:  He was not a cabinet maker himself but in fact a wealthy connoisseur and collector who designed the furnishings for his own house.  The chair takes its form from classical furniture, in particular, the Klismos chair.
Narrator:  The Klismos chair which it curving splayed legs and concave backrest often appears in Ancient Greek imagery, its form was revived in the late 18th Century when archeological discoveries in Italy and Greece fueled the Neoclassical movement in art, architecture and interior design.  The Hope Chair was originally designed to stand in a room displaying classical vases, so its outline may have echoed that of Klismos chairs illustrated on the vases exhibited around it.  Its inlaid decorations are also Greek in inspiration, a lyre appears on the chair back, the Greek key design adorns the seat base and palmettes representing the palms' fan-shaped leaves decorate the legs.  Hope's furniture designs were extremely influential, they were reinterpreted by architects and connoisseurs who visited his splendid London house and copied by cabinet from Hope's publication of his designs which appeared in 1807."""
Sideboard and Wine Cabinet,224.mp3,"""Narrator:  The English architect and designer, William Burges designed this extraordinary sideboard in 1859.  Burges was a key member of the Gothic Revival movement in England.  He advocated a return to the forms, decoration and techniques of Medieval art.  His views were a passionate reaction against the mass produce mediocrity of an increasingly industrial age.  Burges' sideboard borrows elements of Medieval architecture such as the Gothic tracer he painted on the legs of the cabinet.  Above these are two levels of painted decorations, alluding to the sideboard's function as a wine cabinet.  The single heads symbolize different wines.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.
Ghenete Zelleke:  On the right is the blonde head that personifies champagne, on the left is the dark haired man with crown as King Burgundy.
Narrator:  Above these, the arched frames contain a story taken from a Medieval poem that playfully extols the virtues of wine personified as the young Saint Bacchus.  The cabinet's decoration is filled with glowing color and meticulous detail, evoking the richness of Medieval stained glass windows.
Ghenete Zelleke:  This cabinet was made during the reign of Queen Victoria and I think many people have the impression that Victorian interiors were very dark and very gloomy, but you see these brilliant colors and touches of gold in this cabinet and you begin to rethink what Victorian interiors might have been like especially those conceived of by a brilliant man such as William Burges."""
Circular Plaque,225.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  This decorative dish was made in France in the 1880's, it represents a fascinating mix or modern and traditional techniques and influences.  Look closely at the finely detailed portrayal of the young woman, her diaphanous scarf frames a face that seems very much of its time, but she is dressed in a Renaissance style costume.  Behind her, the shimmering golden background features a raised floral design inspired by the repeating flora pattern seen on Islamic ceramics.  The dish was made under the direction of the French ceramicist, Théodore Deck.  Deck was extremely interested in exploring and experimenting with different ceramic techniques and styles, from Turkish wares to Venetian mosaics and Italian Renaissance pottery.  Then he began inviting contemporary artists to collaborate with him turning their hands to pottery decoration.  One of these was Paul César Helleu, who would later become famous for his portraits of beautiful society women.  Helleu took images he had made such as this one of the young woman and transferred them onto lithographic plates, the images were then transfer printed onto ceramics."""
Display Cabinet,226.mp3,"""Narrator:  In this Parisian sideboard of about 1900, a traditional form has been radically transformed, its outline is energized by fluid decorative lines, its flat surfaces echo these with sinuous linear carvings inspired by foliage, flowers and perhaps the floating ribbon like forms of sea plants.  Notice too, the curving root-like shelf brackets.  The cabinet is made in the Art Nouveau or New Art style which flowered at the end of the 19th Century especially in Paris.  As the movement's name suggests, its artists' and designers' aim to create a truly modern kind of art.  They turned away from tradition and instead took the voluptuous asymmetrical curving form seen in nature as the starting point for their inspiration. Louis-Desire-Eugene Gaillard, the cabinet's designer was deeply involved in the Art Nouveau movement, he collaborated on the famous Maison de L'Art Nouveau, a Paris gallery of modern art whose windows were designed by the painter Toulouse-Lautrec and made by Louis Comfort Tiffany.  Gaillard also designed rooms for a modern show house displayed in the Universal Exhibition in Paris held in 1900, among them, a dining room.  This sideboard was originally a part of a second dining room that Gaillard created around that time."""
Cobra Chair,227.mp3,"""Narrator:  This unusual chair is by the Italian designer, Carlo Bugatti.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.
Ghenete Zelleke:  It's called the Cobra Chair because of the way that the spine of the back and the roundel at the top of the chair appear to be like the head of a cobra about to spring forward.
Narrator:  The chair is covered with parchment, delicately painted with insects and floral motifs.  A disk of beaten copper decorates its back.  In fact, the chair is more a sculptural object than a functional piece of furniture.  Bugatti designed it in 1902 as part of an extraordinary circular interior for an international exhibition in Turin, Italy.  Bugatti's room was circular and featured parchment covered banquettes that appeared to grow out of the walls.
Ghenete Zelleke:  And in the center of the room were four chairs of which this was one, standing around a table surface which seemed to emerge out of the shell of a snail, so there was an extraordinary organic and very sensuous atmosphere to this room."""
Sideboard,228.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  The English architect and designer Edward William Godwin designed this sideboard in about 1876 when popular opinion favored highly colored and over decorated furnishings.  Godwin had just moved to London from his native Bristol and started designing furniture for his own apartment.  Godwin was fascinated by the architecture and arts and crafts of Japan.  After Japan reopened itself in the 1850s to international trade following more than 200 years of virtual isolation, its art was eagerly collected in the West, it cast a powerful influence on designers like Godwin.  In his furniture, Godwin reinterpreted the geometric elegance of buildings and furnishings he saw in Japanese prints.
<music plays>
Narrator:  Here he creates a sophisticated conversation between horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines and juxtaposes positive with negative space.  He also accentuates its graphic qualities by painting or ebonizing the mahogany surfaces eliminating any visually distracting grain in the wood.  Godwin was concerned with function as well as form, extensions to the right and left of the sideboard could be raised or lowered depending on the space available in a particular room."""
"Diana ""Diadem""",229.mp3,"""Narrator:  Tiaras were part of a lady's formal evening attire in Edwardian England, often they displayed a dense mass of costly diamonds and pearls.  This unusual and supremely elegant tiara is very different, made of rock crystal, gold and colored enamels, it draws on classical mythology for its design.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.
Ghenete Zelleke:  There's a wonderful narrative embodied in this tiara in that you have three roundels, the center one of which shows the figure of Diana, the Goddess of the Hunt and then at left there are some hunting dogs and at the roundel on the right, there's a fleeing stag and this refers to the story of Actaeon coming upon Diana bathing in a clearing in the forest and Diana being so angered at that, she turned Actaeon into a stag and set his own hunting dogs on Actaeon. 
Narrator:  Notice how Diana, the dogs and the stage each conform gracefully to their surrounding circular forms.  Their pure gold figures are set off by the rich colors of the enameled trees, grass and sky and the transparent rock crystal band beneath.
Ghenete Zelleke:  It's a piece of poetry in jewelry."""
Chest for Photographs,230.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  Intended to store photographs or postcards, this small chest was designed around 1902 by Austrian architect, Josef Hoffmann.  Its drawers are inlaid with sinuous plant like forms in metal, these were inspired by the Art Nouveau or New Art movement which was then extremely fashionable in Paris and other European centers of design.  Meanwhile the clean lines of the chest's overall form look to the British arts and crafts movement which emphasized simplicity of design and expert handcrafting.  But Hoffmann's use of exotic materials seems purely Viennese.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.
Ghenete Zelleke:  In contrast to the more common woods that would have been used on English arts and crafts furniture, here you have this very Viennese sensibility in the use of palisander and maple as veneers on the surfaces of the cabinet.
Narrator:  Hofmann belonged to the Secessionist artist group in Vienna.  These artists aimed to create truly modern art, architecture and interior furnishings and organized exhibitions of their work.
Ghenete Zelleke:  This cabinet was first shown in an exhibition in 1902 but it also appears as part of the interior decoration of a dining room that Hoffmann designed for a contemporary department store."""
Centerpiece: The Scarf Dance (Surtout: Le jeu de l'écharpe),231.mp3,"""Narrator:  The original versions of these exquisitely modeled dancing figures made their debut at the celebrated 1900 Exposition Universelle or Universal Exhibition in Paris.  The figures were part of a set of 15 intended to be grouped together as a dramatic centerpiece for a dining table.  They were made at the Sèvres porcelain manufactory near Paris, by then famous for its delicate creations in unglazed porcelain such as these pieces.  The figures reflect the influence of the Art Nouveau or New Art movement in their fluid curving lines.  These are created by their graceful poses and echoed by their flowing dresses with their sweeping Greek style pleats and wide fluttering sleeves.

Fuller's sensational dances enhanced with whirling billowing silk scarves and ethereal light effects had enthralled Paris in the years leading up to 1900."""
American Gothic,263.mp3,"""Narrator:  Grant Wood's, American Gothic is usually on view in this gallery.  This serious looking pair posed in front of a gothic revival cottage has become one of the most famous American images of the 20th Century.  Wood used his sister and dentist as models for a farmer and his daughter, the daughter is associated with domesticity, to the left of the picture, you can see her flower pots, curtains and household items.  The farmer on the right holding a pitchfork represents men's work.  Together they embody a Victorian idea about the separate the spheres of the sexes.  This painting is also read as an expression of the American character with its emphasis on hard work, self reliance and discipline.  Wood was part of a movement known as Regionalism that began around the time of the Great Depression, it was a time of uncertainty, anxiety and insecurity, millions of Americans found themselves without work struggling to survive.  The American Regionalists responded with a style of art that focused on simple rural themes of everyday life, they purposely rejected the avant-garde styles that were current in European art around this time in favor of images that would be widely understood by a broad audience.  Elsewhere in this gallery, you'll see a large black and blue bowl in a freestanding case.  Nearby are jazz scenes by painter Archibald Motley.  Judith Barter.
Judith Barter:  Archibald Motley chose to depict urban scenes of jazz clubs in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago and jazz was highly important not only to the Black community but as a link between the Black and the White community.  In front of Motley's paintings you will see the Jazz Bowl which Eleanor Roosevelt commissioned for Franklin D. Roosevelt's inauguration in 1931.  Mexican artists are also included in this gallery as they too were searching for a national art and Orozco's portrait of Zapata, the hero of the Mexican Revolution is rendered in an expressionist, jagged, jolting sort of style.
Narrator:  All of these artists have in common a search for a culturally indigenous style of art, one that would reflect local realities and nationalist themes.  When you are finished exploring this gallery, you can walk into the Loja [ph?] a gallery with windows that look out on the train tracks where you can see a collection of small Modernist sculptures."""
"Bourgeois Bust, Jeff and Ilona",284.mp3,"Narrator:  In 1991, Jeff Koons created this sculpture as part of his “Made in Heaven” exhibition, a provocative and often sexually graphic series of works that explored his physical relationship with his new wife, Ilona Staller, an Italian porn star. Associate curator, Kate Nesin.
Kate Nesin:  The title is “Bourgeois Bust, Jeff and Ilona.”  And bourgeois tends to mean most generically middle class, conventional, particularly conventional in one’s taste, materialistic even. I think in this context it also means relatable.  That’s a part of what Koons is getting at a relatability when it comes to one’s relationship or romantic fantasy two people about to kiss embodied in this high art material. 
Narrator:  Unlike his pop predecessors Koons isn’t using mass produced images or processes and elevating them to high art. Instead, he
references the high art of seventeenth and eighteenth century Italian and French sculptures and turns it into something that looks almost mass produced using the visual language of a cotemporary romantic scene. 
Kate Nesin:  There’s the sense of the modern kitsch object, like a couple’s souvenir from a Hawaiian honeymoon or something. At the
same time that we can’t not see the materials and the preciousness of them and the esthetic tradition being summoned through them. There’s a sense of this being maybe a bit of a winking object and yet, it’s incredibly sincere.

Narrator:  No, I didn't think so either.  This is Shukongo-jin, the Thunderbolt God, he's a guardian protecting us all from evil like a bodyguard.  Look at his muscles, I wouldn't want to fight with him and look at his mouth, he might bite.  He doesn't just use his regular eyes to watch out for evil, he's got an extra special third eye in his forehead just for that purpose.  Look at his left hand, he holds his two fingers together, that means beware.  Just in case we still haven't gotten the message yet, look at his other hand, the bar he holds is the thunderbolt.  But this kind of thunderbolt is a little different, it's the thunderbolt of wisdom.  It's wisdom or knowledge that cuts through and destroys evil or the more you know, the stronger you become."""

Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja),304.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  The Hindu story of creation says that the god Shiva danced the world into life and destroyed it the same way over and over again.  This sculpture shows Shiva doing both at the same time, but freezes him like a stop motion photograph.  Shiva has four arms, so he can do lots of things at the same time.  Look at his back pair of hands, on one side, he holds the flame of destruction, it lights the ring of fire around him.  On the other side, he beats a little drum in the rhythm of life.  Now, look at his two front hands, see if you can hold your arms the same way.  Shiva holds one hand above the other, he tips his top hand up which tells a message. 
Shiva:  Fear not.
Narrator:  He points his bottom hand down, that has a message too.
Shiva:  You are freed from ignorance.
Narrator:  Now, see if you can lift your foot up just a little bit and try to balance on one foot like Shiva, he holds this pose perfectly to show us the balance of the universe and he's not standing on a flat floor like you, look under his foot, he's standing on top of a tiny man.
Shiva:  I also stamp out the demon of ignorance as I dance.

Narrator:  That's Chicago artist Kerry James Marshall.
Kerry James Marshall:  That looks like pain to us.
Narrator:  But look at the man's face, he doesn't show any pain.  The spirit that was held inside the wooden sculpture was so strong the force of the nails didn't hurt it, instead, each nail pounded into the figure awoke and activated the spirit's superhuman force.  The Nkisi Nkondi was a hunter, the nails let loose his force to track down criminals and punish them.  He took revenge but he also cured the sick by chasing down the cause of someone's illness.  The Nkisi's power is hidden inside the box on the front of his belly.  Inside might be dirt from a graveyard or special leaves with powerful names.

What kind of story do you think it would be? A ghost story, maybe, or a really funny joke? Centuries and centuries ago, when this sculpture was made in Mexico, telling stories was the way that people passed down knowledge of the important things in their life. They didn't have writing. No books, no magazines and no text messages. Since there was no way to save a story by writing it down, people became their own libraries. They memorized their histories and told them out loud. It's called an oral tradition. They used rhyme and music to help them remember their stories. But the oral tradition didn't go away once people started to read and write.

Narrator:  Now look at the top right corner.
Audio Clip:  The sign of the bird serpent Quetzalcoatl, the lord of the winds, its open beak blows powerful winds. Its long, green feathers are the rain. Hurricanes destroyed the second earth. Those who survived turned into monkeys.
Narrator:  Now move up to the top left corner.
Audio Clip:  He who lies as clouds upon the mountains called Tlaloc, the lord of the rain. A rain of fire like a volcanic eruption consumed a third earth. The people became birds.
Narrator:  Now look at the lower left corner. 
Audio Clip:  Floods ended the fourth earth. The people became fish. The face is Chalchiuhtlicue, she of the jade skirt, goddess of all lakes, rivers, and the sea.
Narrator:  You can see the head of the goddess on a vessel of water. Now look at the center.
Audio Clip:  The X is the present fifth era of creation. The people are now humans, but someday this earth will end as well. X stands for Ollin, and is the sign for movement. The fifth earth will be destroyed by earthquakes.
Narrator:  In the top center, you can see Cipactli, the crocodile, and a dot for the number 1. This is a day name in the Aztec calendar. Down at the bottom of the stone, look at the shape of a reed stalk with 11 dots. This is the year sign Acatl. Together, they mark a date.
Audio Clip:  This date was July 15th, 1503, when Moctezuma, the last Aztec emperor, was crowned in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, where Mexico City is today. This stone was carved by the Aztecs to show that Moctezuma was the ruler of the earth and the whole earth was the Aztec empire.
Narrator:  Now walk around and find the symbol on the back side of the stone.

Ritual Cache,310.mp3,"""<audio clip begins> What do these figures tell us? Let's look closely. There are two people in the center. In front are a little mountain lion and two twisting snakes. At the back are several curving sticks and a woven basket. They were found in a secret cave where they were wrapped up and hidden about 600 years ago deep in the mountains of Southern Arizona. They were put there for safekeeping, maybe in a time of trouble. They tell us of a time when the people who made them lived close with the forces of nature. The Pueblo Indian peoples who live in Arizona now have helped us understand the meaning of these figures. They suggest that the big figure striped with zigzags of turquoise and black may be a powerful lightning spirit who brings dark, sweeping rain to make the crops grow. Perhaps the smaller yellow figure made of stone might be Earth Old Woman. She lives deep below the surface and is a great giver of life, the spirit of the earth itself. The curved sticks are throwing sticks, once used for hunting small game such as rabbits. The mountain lion, the chief animal of prey, is a fierce warrior and lord of the hunt, and the snakes, who are messengers, carry prayers for water and life from humankind down into the earth to the springs and rivers where they live. These figures remind us that all living things, including mountains and rain storms, are joined with people as relatives in the world's circle. <audio clip ends>"""

To make a portrait statue like this, you have to make a lot of decisions. First, you need to pick a pose. Imagine how Lincoln would look standing up instead. <audio clip> Hmm. Maybe he could hold a sword. <audio clip> Or maybe ride a horse that's rearing up in the air. <audio clip> No, that doesn't seem right. Sitting down is better. <audio clip> But what should he sit on?

It should be comfortable but still look important, kind of like well, the chair he's sitting on right now. <audio clip> Beneath his hands, you can see bundles of sticks held together by straps. President Lincoln kept our nation's states together during the Civil War, like these bundles of sticks. Okay, now that we figured out the pose, what should he wear? Some sculptures dress their presidents in sandals and togas like in ancient Rome. <audio clip> No, I don't think so. Lincoln grew up on the frontier.

Everything around the figures, the wall and dresser behind them, the patterned carpet below, is pushed towards us.

The gothic part of the name comes from the building behind the couple. See that skinny, stretched out window on the second floor? The shape is called gothic. What else can you find that's skinny and stretched out? How about the couple? Wood stretched their faces to match the shape of the window. When ""American Gothic"" first appeared in 1930, people either loved it or hated it. The people who loved it thought Grant Wood had made a nice portrait of life in the country. The people who hated it thought he was making fun of country life. What do you think Grant Wood was saying about life on the farm? Well, the more people argued, the more famous this couple and this painting became. And before long, ""American Gothic"" was called an American icon. An icon is an image that everyone can recognize, and in this case have fun with. That house in the background is a real house in the town of Eldon, Iowa.

Karl Wirsum:  And it's almost like shooting a film or a video where you take a location and you kind of figure out what of all the kind of possibilities, how you're going to navigate this kind of thing. And so in a church there's a lot of possibilities here, a lot of things happening there.

Narrator:  Every artist carefully chooses where to pose his or her actors in a painting.
Karl Wirsum:  I mean, if we're in a wedding ceremony, we don't get this kind of close-up view here. So he's kind of bringing us all up right there in back of the bride and groom and the attendants on either side and the minister giving the vows there out of the book.
Narrator:  Lawrence painted the people very simply. We can't even see the bride or groom's faces. Only a tiny bit of the bride's veil is visible under her red hat. But what about the flowers in the background? Those aren't simple at all. Imagine this scene without the flowers. How would it change the mood of this wedding day?

If you can't quite tell what you're looking at, I'm the man to fill you in. These gates were once part of the elevators in one of the most magnificent buildings in Chicago or anywhere else. I should know. I was the head elevator operator there for 37 years. The building was the Chicago Stock Exchange on La Salle Street, and every bit of it was as beautiful as these gates. All those looping vines and swirling leaves and starbursts at the top kept my attention all those years, and the gates below, they kept people safe when the elevator arrived on your floor. <audio clip> Going up. When the elevator went up or down, you could see right through the gates into the empty elevator shaft. <audio clip> Thirteen stories up. A real skyscraper. The Stock Exchange Building is long gone now. Well, so am I for that matter, but I like to come around here and visit and remember. <sighs> Take as long as you like to admire those gates. I'm off duty now, so you'll be waiting a long time for the elevator. <laughs> So long. <audio clip ends>"""
Saint George Killing the Dragon,323.mp3,"""Leslie Baum:  Hi. My name is Leslie Baum, and I am a painter and an art educator here at the Art Institute. We are looking at a painting called ""St. George Killing the Dragon,"" and it is a very dramatic painting with a lot of action in it. <audio clip begins> First you might notice the very ferocious dragon in the lower corner with his exposed teeth and his curling pink tongue and his long tail. And then you'll see St. George on the white horse and the princess in her pink robes standing outside on top of a cave. So here we have our three major players in the story. Beyond the princess, you'll see a castle and castle walls and gardens and a moat and all the villagers locked up, safe and snug, from the dragon. And way in the top balcony, you'll see the queen and the king looking so worried for their beloved daughter. She's probably no more than 15 or 16 years-old. But look at her face. She's so serene and calm. If you were to meet a dragon, would you be so calm? I think this could be like a Hollywood action film. You have everything you need, but it's just in a single paining.
Audio Clip:  Like a lot of Hollywood films, this painted story of St. George had sequels. It was once surrounded by other paintings that told further adventures in the exciting life of the saint. <audio clip ends>"""
The Family Concert,324.mp3,"""<audio clip begins> It might be hard to believe, but once upon a time there was no recorded music. If you wanted to hear some music around your house, you had to make it yourself. This painting is called ""The Family Concert."" When it was made in the 1600s, many paintings from Holland showed happy families playing together like this. <audio clip> Well, maybe they're not so happy. Those pets up front aren't getting along too well. And look at that little boy behind the cat. He's playing the cello, but look at what he's using. It's a long clay pipe, not a cello bow. What a racket. How about your family? If they had a concert, what would it sound like? What kind of music does everyone in your family enjoy? What would it sound like if everyone played their favorite music together? <audio clip ends>"""
Head of Medusa,325.mp3,"""<audio clip begins> Salutations. I am Medusa. Please observe my hairstyle. Each strand of my soft curls is a snake. Once, if you were foolish enough to take just one glance at my face, it would turn you into stone. They called me a monster, but I could not help myself. I was born that way. Not one kiss for me, only despair and loneliness. But then, one day a handsome hero came to visit me. His name was Perseus. In one hand he held a shiny shield and in the other a sword. He turned his back to me and he saw my face reflected in the mirror of his shield. He was safe. He did not turn to stone. So then, you might ask, what then? He sliced off my head. <audio clip> The great Medusa was vanquished. <audio clip ends>"""
Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg),326.mp3,"""Narrator:  <audio clip begins>
Audio Clip:  And another round of applause for our lovely young acrobats.
Narrator:  Looks like we just missed this act at the circus. These girls must have looked really pretty performing together in their golden ribbons and spangley costumes. Even their boots are gold. They look like they could be sisters. Back in the 1870s, it was unusual for anyone to paint a picture of circus girls like these. It wasn't a picture of a king or a god or a battle, just people having fun.
Audio Clip:  Once again on the left, Francisca Wartenberg and on the right her little sister, Angelina, pride of the Circus Fernando.
Narrator:  They are sisters. I wonder what all those   oranges are doing there, though. Maybe they did some juggling?
Audio Clip:  Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen, for showing your appreciation. So many oranges. What a luxury for these girls.
Narrator:  Oh. The audience is tossing them oranges as a special treat. Oranges used to be so expensive. Each one came individually wrapped in tissue paper like a present. No wonder Angelina is filling up her arms with one, two, three-- five oranges. Wow. Being a kid in the circus must be fun. I bet they never have to go to school.
Audio Clip:  If you missed our young ladies here this evening, you can see them six times a day and seven times on Saturday for the rest of the summer here at the Circus Fernando.

The Bedroom,328.mp3,"""Kerry James Marshall:  My name is Kerry James Marshall and I am an artist who lives in Chicago.
Narrator:  Kerry James Marshall stood here on this same spot to look at this painting by Vincent Van Gogh.
Kerry James Marshall:  For me, what I like about Van Gogh is the boldness of his color, the surface, the richness of the paint.
Narrator:  Let's move in closer and check it out.
Kerry James Marshall:  The paint is sort of laid on really thick, and it's laid on not just thick but laid on in short hatch marks and strokes, and you know, those strokes are not blended together.
Narrator:  Painters before Van Gogh brushed on their paint colors so carefully that their canvases were as smooth as glass. They wanted you to forget you were looking at paint. But not Van Gogh. Now step back a little. Van Gogh thought very carefully about what colors he painted next to other colors. He picked colors that would kind of bump up against each other and make us pay attention. Which colors look like that to you? Van Gogh thought this painting would be peaceful and relaxing to look at. Do you think he was right?"""
Golden Bird,329.mp3,"""Narrator: Does this gleaming sculpture remind you of any animal? The artist, Constantin Brancusi, liked this animal so much he made almost 30 other sculptures that look like this one. Can you see the animal yet? I'll give you a hint. <audio clip> It's a bird. Don't quite see it? That's okay. Brancusi wasn't trying to make this sculpture look exactly like a bird, but to feel like one instead. He wanted to capture the ""birdyness"" of a bird, <audio clip> just the way music can remind you of a real bird without sounding exactly like one. Brancusi's bird is singing. Walk around and look at the middle of the sculpture. It swells out like the bird has just taken a big breath. Now look up at the very top. The bird's head is tipped back with its mouth open ready to sing. <audio clip> Brancusi also made the pedestal his shiny bird sits on. He thought this base was just as important as the sculpture on top. Why do you think he chose those shapes and materials to hold up his singing bird?"""
Personages with Star,330.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  Artist Joan Miró wanted his paintings to be fun to look at and he had fun making them.
Karl Wirsum:  So one of the places I would start here would be finding the thumbs up sign in this one.
Narrator:  That's Karl Wirsum, he's a Chicago artist who also likes to have fun.
Karl Wirsum:  This painting feels real good about itself by having the thumbs up and it looks like the old game of pick-up sticks where you kind of throw things down and there's this kind of pattern on the floor.  There are some artists that will cut out pieces of paper and they just kind of throw them on the ground and then that'll be the composition.
Narrator:  See if you can find other parts of people or other more fantastic creatures.
Karl Wirsum:  I kind of think of them as not being anchored to the earth in any way and just kind of floating around, bouncing off the top of the frame there, the top of the painting and the kind of bouncing back a little bit.
Narrator:  As you keep looking, you might see more hands or feet or faces but Miró keeps you guessing, he painted them so you can't be sure which parts belong to which creature."""
Untitled (Soap Bubble Set),331.mp3,"""Narrator:  It might take a minute to let your eyes get used to the darkness in this room but when they do, you'll be able to see the wonders contained in this little box made by Joseph Cornell.
Leslie Baum:  I'm sure all of you have a collection of something at home that you like and Joseph Cornell was just like that.
Narrator:  That's Leslie Baum, she's an artist who teaches about art here at the museum.
Leslie Baum:  First you might notice that there is a yellow ball that seems to be hovering in the sky and on closer looking you will see it's resting on these skinny, slender metal bars.  And behind it is a picture of a moon and what I love is how this very simple humble ball that's probably made of cork looks like the moon.
Narrator:  Joseph Cornell made lots and lots of boxes like this, some of them, like this one were meant to be picked up and played with.
Leslie Baum:  You can imagine taking it off the wall and holding it in your hands and gently tilting it from side to side and the ball would roll.
Narrator:  But look closer and you'll see that some things like the goblet or the broken pipe are nailed to the bottom.
Leslie Baum:  I love them too because they're full of wonder and you can look at them and imagine Joseph Cornell's dreams and maybe your own dreams too.
Narrator:  If you made a box, what would it look like?"""
Greyed Rainbow,332.mp3,"""Narrator:  Try tilting your head sideways to the left or to the right as you look at this painting.  Or maybe you can twist around so you're looking at the painting upside down.  Can you find a top or a bottom?  It's not so easy, is it?  That's because the artist, Jackson Pollock created a new way of painting.  He started by taking his blank canvas off the wall and throwing it flat on the floor.  That way, he could walk around all four sides to paint.  Now here's where we get to paint too.  Pick one line in the painting.  Got one?  Now see if you can trace that line in the air with your finger as it twists, squiggles and spatters.  Jackson Pollock did almost the same thing, he took a stick and dipped it into a bucket of paint then he leaned out over the canvas and flicked and dripped and threw the paint across it.  Go ahead, see how it feels.  When he painted, it looked a little like a dance or maybe a boxing match where he was the only fighter.  Now step back and look at the finished painting, it isn't a picture of anything that Jackson Pollock saw, it's a picture of what he did.  Pollock said he wanted to be in his paintings.  Can you still see him?"""
Nighthawks,351.mp3,"""Woman 1:  This painting is titled Nighthawks by Edward Hopper.  Nighthawks are birds that fly around at night like owls and people who like to go out at night or stay up late are sometimes called nighthawks.
Man 1:  This painting looks like it's the middle of the night, the sidewalks are empty, there's no traffic and the stores in the background are closed.  So do you think this was painted recently or some time ago?  Let's see if we can tell by looking at some things in the diner.  Let's take five seconds.
Woman 1:  The coffee cups look the same as today and the napkin dispensers, the salt and pepper shakers and the stools at the counter, but the sign at the top of the painting for five cent cigars tells us this is an old painting.  Hopper painted it in 1942 more than 70 years ago.
Man 1:  Hopper loved the theater and the movies, especially how they used lighting to create dramatic effects.  How do you think he uses lighting to create the mood of this painting?  I think it looks like a scene from a play that we're watching through the window.  I wonder what the artist was thinking when he painted it.
Woman 1:  Why don't we ask the people in the painting, they might know?  Excuse me, we couldn't help but notice that even though there are a few people in the restaurant, no one seems to be talking to or looking at each other.
Man 2:  Well, that's how Hopper wants us to look.  Hey, Joe, how about another cup of coffee for me and the lady?
Joe:  Yes, sir, coming right up.
Josephine:  We're in New York, you know, in Greenwich Village, it's a big city full of people but sometimes it can feel kind of lonely.  I think that's what my husband was painting.

Roswell Googins:  You know, I can tell you all about that painting.
Woman 1:  What?  Who are you?
Roswell Googins:  Name's Roswell Googins and when I was a boy, Mr. Winslow Homer hired me to row him out near the fishing boats so he could sketch the scene then later he made paintings from those sketches like this one.  He thought the fishermen were like heroes, battling the wind and storms and rough seas doing a job that could sometimes be very dangerous and that's how he painted them.
Man 1:  Yes, especially in a storm with those big waves.  But can you please explain something else, the older man on the right is pulling in the herring, what's the young man doing on the other side of the boat?

Luis Jimenez:  A very good question.  While I tell you, see if you can tell how many colors I am using in this weaving.  Bueno.  Diego is proud to be Mexican and proud of the art like weaving which we have practiced for a long, long time even from the time before the Spanish were here.
Woman 1:  Why were the Spanish in Mexico?
Luis Jimenez:  Ah, Spain conquered our country in the 1500s and we were their colony until the 1800s then we fought for our independence and won it.  Oh yes, and by the way, I am weaving with four colors, red, blue, black and white.  Did you see them all?

Woman 1:  No, he's a Greek warrior.  The Roman sculptor copied a statue by a Greek sculptor named Phidias.  The Romans really admired the Greeks from centuries earlier especially their art and often copied their statues.  The warrior has just been wounded in the back and he's sinking to the ground.  See his right hand reaching behind him, do you think looks afraid or like he's in pain?
Man 1:  No, I think he looks very calm and very brave but I don't think it looks like a real battle scene.  Where's his helmet and his weapon?  At least he's got a shield.

Phidias:  Ah, because I wanted him to look more like a hero or a great athlete than a soldier.  Look at the muscles in his chest and see the headband he wears, that's what Greek athletes wore.  Greek soldiers were athletes too and competing in sports, it was part of their training for battle.  If you think he looks brave and heroic then I'm happy.  Excuse me, I have to get back to work now.

Woman 2:  The story is told from ancient times of a female goddess named Parvati, she had a son, Ganesha and one day she wanted to take a bath and she told her son to guard the door and let no one come in, absolutely no one.  But then Parvati's husband, the great Hindu god Shiva who had not yet met Parvati's son came along and demanded to come in.  They boy wouldn't let him in and Shiva got so angry that he cut off the boy's head.  When Shiva realized that he had cut off the head of Parvati's son, he felt so sorry that he sent his attendants out and told them to bring back the head of the first creature they met.  They came back with the head of an elephant.  <elephant roars>  Shiva put it on the boy's body and Ganesha came back to life.  So the story had a happy ending.  And over the years, Ganesha became known as a happy funny god with a big round belly because he likes to eat so much especially candy.
Woman 1:  Because Ganesha was so brave in guarding the door, Hindus also worship him as the Guardian of Entrances and you see pictures or statues of him near many doorways and he often has a bowl of candy in his hand."""

In this sculpture he has the body of a man and the head of a boar, a wild pig, but you can tell it's Vishnu because he carries a seashell in one hand, a musical instrument he blows into to scare off demons.  By the way, Vishnu had four arms but on this statue two are broken off.

Man 3:  The story took place a long time ago, how the earth goddess, Prithvi was floating peacefully on the sea when a demon captured her and took her to the bottom of the ocean.  Ocean waves began to flood the earth and people were scared and the earth goddess cried out to Vishnu for help, so Vishnu turned himself into Varaha, a wild boar, a fierce creature of the land who can also fight in water.  Varaha dove to the bottom of the ocean, defeated the demon and rescued Prithvi and the earth was safe once again.
Woman 1:  In this sculpture you can see sea snakes trying to wrap themselves around Varaha's legs but he has won and he is looking up at the rescued Prithvi who's the earth goddess."""

Child:  Yummy.
Man 1:  Where do you think this piece of furniture was made?  The people in the paintings look like they might be Chinese.
Woman 1:  The cabinet was made in England in the 1700s and was decorated with imitation Chinese paintings.  People in Europe had started traveling to China more and more and fell in love with Chinese art and design.  So they began to decorate their furniture with Chinese paintings.  The biggest paintings here are inside the cabinet doors.  On the left is a woman holding a palm branch, on the right is a warrior holding a banner.  What other paintings can you see?

The city had been rebuilt, dark narrow streets filled with small buildings were replaced with wide, bright avenues and tall large buildings.
Man 1:  But if he wanted to make the city look good, why paint it in the rain?

Man 1:  I see a lamp post right in the middle, were lamp posts new?
Woman 1:  These were because they were powered by gas.  Remember, this is before electric lights were invented, it was dark at night and a little spooky.  Gas lamp posts made it easier for people to go out at night.
Man 1:  You know what's funny, the left side feels so open but on the right side, it looks like there's no space.  I think the man and woman together don't see the man on the right edge of the painting coming at them.

Man 1:  But Mrs. Thorne wasn't making dollhouses to play with, this one shows how a traditional Japanese home looked, it's not filled with a lot of furniture because that's how the Japanese liked it.  Mrs. Thorne wanted her rooms to show how people lived in different countries and at different times.  She had traveled the world and had visited many of the countries represented here.
Woman 1:  She hired 30 men and women to help her design and build everything you see and they used the same materials as you'd find in a real house.  In these rooms, something that's one inch long would be one foot long in real life.  If you are four feet tall, inside the boxes you would shrink to four inches tall.
Man 1:  This Japanese room shows the main living space of a home, called a zajiki [ph?].  If you could go inside this house, what would you explore?  Would you bring anybody with you?

Buddha,401.mp3,"""Narrator: Woman 4:  This object of great dignity and nobility was made in China sometime in the 8th Century.  Buddhism had first come to China from India about six centuries earlier but it flourished during the Tang Dynasty when this sculpture was made.  The Buddha sits cross-legged on a lotus throne, his eyes are slightly open looking down at us in meditation, he wears simple monks' robes and no jewelry.  Notice his elongated ear lobes where he removed his heavy earrings, they're a reminder of when he renounced worldly pleasures and gave up his possessions in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment.  A sign of his enlightenment is the bump on the top of his head called an ushnisha.  A statue of Buddha may have any combination of 32 marks called Lakshanas that indicate his superior status, for example, his idealized physique, the ushnisha and the round dot in the center of his forehead called an urna.  Buddhas are often shown in postures of meditation.  Notice too that the Buddha's chest appears inflated, it's filled with prana, life giving air.  If you turn around, you'll see two bodhisattvas, they're in the niches nearby on the platforms flanking the staircase.  Bodhisattvas are compassionate beings who have attained enlightenment but choose to remain in this world to help the rest of us get there.  They're portrayed as princes, their hair combed in high top knots and wearing arm bands and necklaces.  Originally these bodhisattvas flanked the Buddha and were part of a larger grouping placed on an altar or platform inside a temple.  Together they were meant to help the worshiper visualize the land of enlightenment.  It's hard to miss the sensuality of the Buddha's physical form especially his face, it is a sign of how Indian art influenced Chinese art.  This sculpture was a gift to the Art Institute from Lucy Maud Buckingham, an early supporter of the Art Institute and the same woman who gave the Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park and the great statue of Alexander Hamilton in Lincoln Park to the citizens of Chicago.  Lucy Maud Buckingham was a great patron of the arts in Chicago, she and many others since have contributed greatly to the cultural life of our great city."""
Seated Bodhisattva,402.mp3,"""Narrator: We now stand in front of a bodhisattva, in Japanese, a bosatsu from the Nara period.  It was made sometime in the late 8th Century and was probably once part of a larger group of deity figures.  The bodhisattva still wears the decorative trappings of the material world like jewelry and elaborate robes unlike the Buddha who has given up such things.  His hands with thumbs and index fingers touching are in a gesture of teaching.  The bodhisattva chose to remain among us after achieving enlightenment in order to help the rest of us pursue our spiritual liberation.  It was during the Nara period that Buddhism initially flowered in Japan and the city of Nara was its center.  Gathered in Nara were the greatest artists of the time and the quality of this sculpture is exceptional, it's carved from many pieces of wood over which the sculptor layered lacquer and gold leaf.  It's a very beautiful object even though or perhaps because the original gold color has been blackened by soot from countless prayer candles.  This is one of those very, very rare examples, one of three we think of Nara school sculpture in the United States.  And it's interesting to note that the flowering of Buddhist art in Nara Japan was simultaneous with the achievement of Tang culture in China.  If you go look at the enormous Tang Chinese stone Buddha in the main hall outside this gallery, you can compare the two.  The obvious difference is in scale, the monumentality of the Chinese versus the intimacy of the Japanese.  But there is an eloquence and an elegance that unites them."""
Bird Shaped Ewer with Crowned Rider Holding a Bowl,404.mp3,"""Narrator: This beautiful ceramic sculpture depicting a bird was made a millennium ago during the Goryeo Dynasty in Korea, it is a ewer or pitcher made of stoneware with a celadon glaze.  The celadon technique gives this pitcher and the other ceramics in this gallery their beautiful bluish green colors.  Celadon came to Korea from China but Korean potters created superb versions of their own and the Goryeo Dynasty is particularly known for the flowering of celadon.  The bird's body resembles a duck but its head is crowned with a rooster's coxcomb and the wings seem small for the body.  Even more curious and whimsical is the human figure standing on the bird's back holding a bowl.  If you look through the glaze, you can see the body of these vessels is a cool grey, the details of the bird and the rider's clothing were carefully incised in the clay before glazing.  Celadon glaze has a lot of iron in it and when this vessel was fired in a very hot oxygen starved kiln, the iron turned green.  In the areas where the glaze is thin like the edges of the wings, it turned slightly brown.  You can see the deepest blue green color in the places where the glaze pooled like the carved areas around the figure.  Notice also how the glaze crackled across the surface, it's a very feeling work of art and a technical achievement of a high order.  In this gallery you can look at many other examples of celadon glazed ceramics, some are darker blue, some are more blue green.  Look for those with the most delicate and consistent glazes, these are the most prized by connoisseurs of East Asian ceramics."""

It's from the Shang Dynasty, China's earliest known dynasty and dates to the 12th to 11th Century BC or more than 3,000 years ago.  This fact alone is extraordinary especially when we recall that Greek bronzes of comparable quality were not produced until the 5th or 6th Century BC or some 800 years later.  Notice the stout legs, massive handles and substantial body of this otherwise diminutive vessel.  There is always a boldness to Shang bronzes, a physical firmness to their full forms and a refinement to the detail decoration too with an emphasis on symmetry.  Look closely and you can see mirrored pairs of birds in profile cast in high relief atop each wall, their long trailing tails and feathers stand out from a background of squared spirals.  At the top of each leg, you can see ogre masks known as taotie, bisecting each of these masks projecting out at a diagonal are thick flanges edged with curving forms.  Vessels of this style are associated with Anyang which was the center of the Shang Dynasty in its late period.  Similar vessels have been found in tombs at Anyang and other regions of North China.  They were probably ritual objects used to hold food offerings for ancestors.  Notably, this vessel is a historical document as well as a work of art.  If you look inside the vessel you will see an inscription on the bottom, it records the name of someone's father in whose memory the vessel was dedicated."""
Veranda Post of Enthroned King and Senior Wife (Opo Ogoga),408.mp3,"""Narrator: This towering sculpture once greeted visitors entering the palace of the king or ogoga of Ikere, a small town in South Western Nigeria.  He is depicted at center seated on his throne.  Behind the king stands his senior wife while smaller figures stand or kneel at the king's feet.  It's a dynamic and visually complex sculpture made by Olowe of Ise, one of the greatest Yoruba sculptors of the 20th Century.  Olowe lived in residence at the Ogoga's palace from 1914 to 1918 and sculpted numerous objects for him.  Like many Yoruba sculptures, hierarchy is integral to the meaning of this work, the size and solidity of the senior wife is symbolic of the importance of women in Yoruba society.  She gazes downward toward the smaller king, her hands rest protectively on his throne, in fact, her pose is meant to remind us that at his coronation it is the senior wife who stands behind the king and places the crown on his head.  In other words, men can't rule without the support of women.  Walk around and look at the multiple strands of beads around her waist and the scarification on her back, both signs of her high status.  Her body is blue.  If we walk back around to the front, we can see that the king on the other hand was painted in a deep reddish color which has since faded.  This color combination not only suggests a complementary balance between the two, it also carries a symbolic meaning.  For the Yoruba, blue is symbolic of atutu [ph?], a concept referring to the inner power and calm reserve of women.  Red is symbolic of assay [ph?] or the king's power and life force.  Although the king is small, he is the center of the composition, on top of his head is a conical beaded crown, a sign of his divine origin and a link to past rulers.  Such a crown can be seen in the case to the right.  The faces depicted on Yoruban crowns have multiple meanings.  One interpretation is that they represent the king's ancestors and their spiritual power among the living."""
Oba's Altar Tusk,409.mp3,"""Narrator: Africa has a long and rich artistic legacy and the sophisticated ivory and brass sculptures of the Kingdom of Benin, in present day Nigeria are among its most celebrated masterpieces.  They first came to the attention of Europeans and Americans in 1897 following the sacking of Benin City by British forces.  The refined plaque fragment on the back wall of this case was purchased by the Art Institute in 1933 and was one of the first African artworks to enter the museum's collection.  The large and sumptuously embellished elephant tusk to the left previously stood on the royal altar atop a brass head.  You can see one of these brass heads made to support a smaller tusk to the right.  In Benin, the oba or king is considered a divine ruler, he typically commissions altar tusks when he ascends to the throne.  This tusk was made for Oba Odolo who was in oba in the 1860s.  Like all tusks, its covered in relief sculpture depicting past obas as well as palace priests, warriors and other symbols of royalty and power.  Together these images legitimize the ancestry of the oba.  The image of a mudfish appears several times, for instance towards the tusk's bottom we can see an oba holding two abstracted mudfish aloft in his hands.  They have long whiskers like catfish, different types of mudfish are found in the rivers of Southern Nigeria.  One species' powerful electric shock is associated with the oba's power over his enemies.  Other species can survive on land and water symbolizing the oba's ability to live in both the human and spiritual realms.  But beyond the imagery carved on this tusk, ivory itself was a symbol of the oba's power and legitimacy.  In the 18th and 19th Centuries, obas held a virtual monopoly on the ivory trade.  Beyond its value as a trade good, carved ivory brings to mind the wisdom, strength and long life of the elephant, important foundations for the authority of Benin's ruler."""
Figure of a Seated Leader,410.mp3,"""Narrator: This is a figure of a seated chieftain, it comes from Vera Cruz along the Gulf Coast of present day Mexico and it was made sometime between the years 300 and 600 AD.  The arts of the ancient civilizations of Mexico and Central America are among the world's finest, especially their achievements in ceramics and stoneware sculpture and this piece is an exceptional example.  The figure sits in a position of authority, an authority that derives from the concentrated tense power of his form, the attributes of his costume and the dignity of his expression.  It's made of fire terracotta clay, the natural color of the clay has dark patched due to uneven firing adding drama to the figure.  Complementing the abstracted simplified body shape are the elegant headdress, ornate jewelry and an embroidered kilt.  As far as who is depicted and how this sculpture was used, we can't be sure.  These kinds of figures seldom depict gods, most, like this one, appear to represent individuals of high rank, they would have been ancestors of aristocratic family lineages.  Like others of its type, this figure probably once stood inside or in front of a small house like temple built upon a flat topped pyramid platform.  It is an effigy intended as a memorial to the deceased.  It looks to be in excellent condition but apparently was, like many others intentionally shattered on the steps of a pyramid, perhaps as an offering to the ancestral dead.  But it may have been destroyed by rivals or an enemy people.  It has since been carefully reconstructed."""
Standing Male Figure,411.mp3,"""Narrator: Dating to between 650 and 800 AD, these small figures are roughly contemporary to the life size seated figure behind you.  These figures have been found in the Yucatan Peninsula and nearby areas of present day Mexico in the heartlands of ancient Maya civilization.  They are astounding achievements in working with clay on a small almost jewel like scale.  They are partly made from molds then further modeled, fired and painted.  Notice the anatomical features of the bodies and the expressions of the faces, they're absolutely convincing portrayals of human form and character.  In terms of what they're for, they were tomb figures, many are warriors such as this tall standing man meant to acknowledge the fighting spirit of the deceased.  The exceptionally charming standing male figure, the red one holding his round belly up is a rattle in the form of a mythological figure and that belly no doubt has pellets in it that rattle to invoke a supernatural spirit accompanied by musical chance.  Notice the way the foreground figure is being pulled forward by his belly, his shoulders are dropped, the pose is amazing, he looks so lifelike like the Maya people we see living in the Yucatan today.  He, like other figures nearby is certainly not a mythological creature, they portray the people living in a particular time and place, they have human character.  When you walk by, if you spend just a second you will be transfixed by them, they truly provide one of the most magical moments in the museum."""
Coronation Stone of Motecuhzoma II (Stone of the Five Suns),412.mp3,"""Narrator: This stone sculpture is called the Stone of the Five Suns, it commemorates the beginning of the warlike reign of the Aztec ruler Motecuhzoma II, previously known as Montezuma.  It was found in the ruins of the ritual center of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital destroyed by the Spanish conqueror, Hernán Cortés in 1521.  The ruins today are beneath downtown Mexico City.  The carved hieroglyphs covering the stone's surface place Motecuhzoma II's coronation within the sacred cosmic history of the world and give legitimacy to his reign.  On the front, you'll see hieroglyphs in each of the four corners, they denote the cataclysmic end of four previous epics or eras called suns in Nahuatl, the Aztec language.  Moving counterclockwise from the lower right, you will first see the head of a spotted jaguar, naming the era called 4 Jaguar then the mask of the wind god or 4 Wind then the mask of the rain god for an era called 4 Rain and finally, the head of the goddess of rivers, lakes and the sea, naming the era called 4 Flood.  The X in the center is the sign of the current era, 4 Movement, predicted to end in violent earthquakes.  In the top center, you can see a crocodile that names a specific day, July 15th, at the bottom, a rectangle encloses the year, date, 11 Read, corresponding to 1503 in the Christian calendar, this was the year of Motecuhzoma II's coronation day.  On the sides of the stone, you could see four identical hieroglyphic figures, these depict the squatting Earth Goddess holding up each of the four quarters of the world.  The square stone itself represents the world."""
Belly-Amphora (Storage Jar),418.mp3,"""Narrator: This is a 6th Century Greek storage jar called an amphora, you see several of them in this case.  It's decorated with a scene from the story of the Twelve Labors of Herakles, which tested his strength and moral fiber.  In this particular episode, Herakles battles a lion who couldn't be killed by weapons, so the lion had to be wrestled to death.  Greek vase paintings are like snapshots from antiquity, they reveal or document the daily life of the Greeks, their rituals and in this case their mythology.  This is a particular style of vase painting called the black-figure style, the black figures and shapes are painted in silhouette over the natural reddish clay background.  Some such vases may reflect Greek monumental painting which unlike Greek architecture, sculpture and ceramic ware does not survive.  Vases like this one show clearly that Greek painters appreciated a sophisticated sense of line and the rhetoric of gesture and expression.  The Greeks used the same word poiesis for both the production of things such as images and pots and the writing of poetry.  And for them, the making of things or poems was synonymous with making things beautiful, that is with proportion, harmony, precision and reason.  And it was through vases like this one and the others around you since Greek wall and panel painting did not survive that painters of the Renaissance and of the Neoclassical period of the 18th Century learned of Greek painting."""
Desk,420.mp3,"""Narrator: This tour includes a window by the great architect, Frank Lloyd Wright and here we see a desk from the late 1930s made at a much later time of his career.  This desk was part of a major commission, the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin, both the building and the furniture are characterized by low curves and rounded forms, very different than the style of his earlier work which was more architectonic and angular.  Throughout his career, Wright promoted the notion of organic unity which meant that an interior and its furnishing were important to the overall concept of a building, he sought to create a total environment, not just a building.  Wright was commissioned to make all of the furniture and interior fittings that went into the Johnson Wax Building including the various working desks and chairs intended for different office tasks.  This desk and chair were made for the main office area called the Great Room.  As designed by him, the building was conceived as a complete work of art.  The Johnson Wax Building is an oblong building made of brick and glass.  The glass was built up in several layers in tubing rather than in sheets so that it emitted light but no view and all of these rounded forms were set within this curved wall environment.  The main working space or Great Room is an open atrium that rises two stories within which there are these great columns that rise from the floor almost like trees in a forest.  In this desk you can detect the influence of streamlining, a style popular in the 1930s, its rounded surfaces allude to speed and dynamism, symbols of modernism.  You can still visit Wright's Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin, just a few hours north of Chicago."""
The Herring Net,421.mp3,"""Narrator: This painting, called the Herring Net is by Winslow Homer, Homer painted it in 1885.  Two anonymous fishermen pull a net filled with herring into their boat.  The man facing us bends over his work head down, the other man turns his back toward us and hangs over the edge of the boat to counterbalance the weight of the fish.  There is a grandeur about them, they appear as heroic representatives of humanity, alone and struggling with the forces of nature.  This is not a depiction of particular figures or of mundane life lived by the sea but a dramatic painting of the highest order.  In this gallery are some of Homer's earlier paintings showing croquet, mountain climbing and other leisure activities that were popular in the period just after the Civil War.  But Homer's later work is very different, in 1880 however, he spent some time in the fishing village of Gloucester, Massachusetts.  The next year he observed fishermen and their families in Cullercoats, England on the North Sea.  And in 1883, he moved from New York to Prouts Neck on the coast of Maine where he lived the rest of his life.  No doubt his daily contact with the hardened men and women of the sea impressed him deeply, they inspired pictures of a scale and dramatic intensity far different than anything he had painted before.  This painting was once in the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Martin Ryerson.  Mr. Ryerson was a generous supporter of the Art Institute and a donor to our library which is named in his honor.  Like almost every American museum, the Art Institute's collection is the result of generous donations from private individuals.  You will find the Ryerson name on other works of art on view in our galleries.  Other names to look for include the Palmers of Palmer House fame, Frederic Clay and Helen Birch Bartlett who gave the Art Institute numerous important paintings from Seurat's Grande Jatte to Picasso's The Old Guitarist and of course, Lucy Maud Buckingham who gave the museum so much of its important Asian art."""
Sideboard,422.mp3,"""Narrator: This sideboard was made around 1880 in a style called Modern Gothic, so called because its forms were inspired by Medieval motifs.  The rich ornamented surface includes images of game birds and stylized cat tails.  The subject of the hand carved elm and walnut panel on the left and right cabinet doors is the story of the Fox and the Stork from Aesop's fables, it is a tale of false generosity in which the fox invites the stork to dinner and offers her clear broth in a shallow bowl.  Because of her long beak, she cannot eat her dinner, in return, the crane invites the fox to supper and serves the meal in a jar with a long neck which the fox cannot access.  Imagine this story on a piece of furniture intended for a dining room where dinner plates and eating utensils would be stored.  This hand worked sideboard is part of a late 19th Century English and American reform movement, sometimes called the Aesthetic movement, its artists promoted the integrity of hand work against anonymous industrialized production and the educational role of art in the home which they hoped would foster a moral society."""
Nightlife,424.mp3,"""Narrator: This painting called Night Life depicts the energy and excitement of a jazz club in the South Side Chicago neighborhood of Bronzeville.  In the 1930s and '40s Bronzeville was home to more than 90 percent of the city's Black population and as you can see, it was also the center of a vibrant jazz scene.  Bronzeville ballrooms and nightclubs attracted such distinguished performers as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway and Ella Fitzgerald.  Archibald Motley painted this picture after studying at the School of the Art Institute.  He was born in New Orleans but his family moved to Chicago as part of the African American migration north at the turn of the 20th Century.  Night Life is about movement, the energy of jazz and the subterranean quality of a darkened club lit by artificial light.  At the left, a man gestures to a woman at the bar, maybe he's asking her to dance, his right arm moves our eye to the center where a couple embraces frozen in mid step, their paired arms and legs create a diagonal that brings our eye up the waiter behind them and beyond to the crush of dancers in the background.  Notice the intense color of the pink walls and floors and the purplish lighting that picks up highlights of skin and clothing.  These kind of hot jarring colors are what you find in a dark artificially lit bar.  This picture is also about race and social dynamics, Motley wanted to portray African Americans as he put it, ""Just the way they are.""  With paintings like this, Motley believed he could help dispel stereotypes and raise the consciousness of all Americans.  At the time, jazz was associated alcohol, drugs and prostitution but it was also a musical style and way of life that was changing American society.  More and more Whites were frequenting jazz clubs like this where social and racial barriers fell away if only for an evening."""
Chicago Stock Exchange: Bank of Five Elevator Grilles with Four Plates,426.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  We are standing in a gallery dedicated to Chicago architecture looking at elevator grills from Louis Sullivan's famous Stock Exchange Building, built in Chicago on the Southwest corner of LaSalle and Washington in 1893 to 1894.  These grills enclosed the elevator shafts and provided visual continuity with the banks of sliding elevator doors.  If you look at the lush organic decoration that covers the surface and then think that they're made of steel, you're confronted with one of Sullivan's most important architectural ideas, Sullivan made buildings using the most modern materials in technology but at the same time, he believed architecture ought to humanize the environment and elevate the taste of the people around it.  Sullivan is a towering figure of modern architecture, his Auditorium Building, south along Michigan Avenue from here was the largest building of its time in America, its decoration, ingenuity of form and perfect acoustics are celebrated still today.  Sadly, the Stock Exchange Building was torn down in 1971 in a spirit of modernization, its destruction sparked a new awareness of our historical built environment in Chicago.  Fortunately the building's trading room was saved by a Chicago architecture conservation group and later reconstituted elsewhere in this museum.  The same group of people helped us acquire this elevator grill, many of the architectural fragments within this gallery as well as the stock exchange arch that stands outside the Columbus Drive entrance to this museum.  If you look to your right and then up, you'll find a stained glass window by Frank Lloyd Wright, another toweringly important modern architect from Chicago.  Wright made this window in 1912 for the home of Avery Coonley who lived in nearby Riverside, it hung in the children's playroom.  Coonley was a patron and an important advocate of the kindergarten movement in the early part of the 20th Century.  In Wright's window, you'll find visual references to the American flag, balloons, child's play toys.  He clearly meant for the window to be fun and decorative but it was also a serious exercise, it reflects Wright's vision of modern architecture and design which was at odds with Sullivan's more ornamental approach.  Chicago is the home of modern architecture and the city with the greatest surviving examples of modern architecture from the 1890s.  The great German architect, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe came to Chicago in the 1930s from the Bauhaus to direct what is today called the Illinois Institute of Technology.  His influence as a teacher and architect helped establish the Second School of Chicago Architecture which is characterized by a spare elegance of form and use of modern industrial materials.  This can be seen on the campus if IIT just a few miles south of the Art Institute."""
Paris Street; Rainy Day,427.mp3,"""Narrator: Perhaps no other part of our collection is as beloved as the galleries of French Impressionist painting, no doubt this is due in part to the depth and quality of our holdings.  Our holdings of work by Monet for example are unrivaled outside France.  But it is also because of the era of Impressionism, the last decades of the 19th Century that coincides with the building of the modern City of Chicago.  In fact, the Michigan Avenue building in which you are now standing dates from just this period, 1893 when many of the French Impressionist artists were at the peak of their careers.  This painting by Gustav Caillebotte is perhaps the best known of our Impressionist pictures, it depicts the street life of ordinary middle class and working class Parisians on a scale normally reserved for paintings of heroic scenes from antiquity or the Bible.  Nothing much is really going on, focus is on the dramatic spatial recession down the streets and the crossing of social types.  We are drawn to the particulars of their facial features and dress and particularly to the scalloped edges of the many umbrellas.  It is a painting more about pictorial composition than dramatic action, the openness of the left half of the painting within which two streets veer off left and right and the crowded right half of the picture.  Here the repeated vertical pattern of light posts and architectural details are countered by the animated silhouettes of the figures striding toward us passing the man on the right who seems to have stepped into the painting from our side as it were as if we too could enter and walk the streets of Paris ourselves.  The painting emphasizes the modern in composition, dress and architecture.  At the time of its painting and exhibition in 1877, Paris was undergoing a radical transformation, railway stations were being built, streets and avenues were being extended, large middle class apartment buildings were going up.  It was an expansion and rethinking of Paris not unlike that which Chicago underwent after the fire of 1871.  If you look around this room, you may see similar scenes of modern life painted in a palette dominated by the blue greys of the city, these paintings attest to a particular moment in modern painting when the Impressionist group was most coherent and exhibiting together.  This painting was shown in the Impressionist Exhibition of 1877, Impressionist exhibitions were in themselves modern phenomena, they were among the first artist organized exhibitions that allowed the participating artists themselves to choose which of their works to exhibit and to sell them directly to their public.  Buyers of Impressionist works would come from many foreign cities, Chicago among them.  Many of the paintings in this and succeeding galleries were acquired by some of the Art Institute's earliest donors, they bought them as contemporary paintings and they gave them to the Art Institute for the benefit of Chicagoans.  In this respect, the Art Institute which is now a great encyclopedic museum with collections of almost all of the world's many artistic cultures began life as a modern and contemporary art museum."""
Ecce Agnus Dei,428.mp3,"""Narrator:  These six panels by the Sienese master Giovanni di Paolo are in very good condition, they're part of a larger series.  Related panels belong to the collections of four other museums.  In the first of the Art Institute's panels, John the Baptist is shown leaving Judea and descending into the mountain wilderness where he went to preach.  He appears twice in this panel, once down below leaving the city and then again ascending into the mountains represented as these gothic looking spires.  In this panel and the one next to it, the landscape is treated as a pattern with a flat graphic quality.  The way Giovanni di Paolo renders the landscape suggests that he's experimenting with recent innovations in the use of perspective but he is perhaps more inclined toward fantasy and imagination.  In all six of the panels, there is a disparity between the scale of the figures and the architecture and the landscape, this gives the panels a vivid eccentricity and makes them more fantastic than realistic.  In the second panel, we see John gesturing toward Jesus who stands on the other side of the River Jordan indicating to the crowd of followers that Jesus is the Messiah.  In the next panel, we see John in prison.  As the story goes, John has denounced Herod for his illicit marriage.  Herod, fearing John's growing popularity has imprisoned him.  In the fourth panel, we see the infamous moment when Salome after dancing before Herod pleads with her stepfather for John's head on a platter, he has granted her one wish and this is what she asks for.  What follows is the beheading described in gruesome detail, the blood pouring from the neck while a soldier stands by and another retrieves the head.  And in the final scene, Herod and his guests recoil in horror as they are presented with the severed head.  All six panels display hallmarks of Giovanni di Paolo's very expressive mature style.  Notice the sharp definition of the features and the thin elegant fingers on the hands, the poses are somewhat exaggerated which helps to communicate the story.  The artist has imbued each of the figures with a unique personality, the disheveled appearance of John the Baptist consist with his role as a desert preacher or the evident concern of John's followers visiting him in prison or the melodrama of Salome's beseeching gesture.  The sinuous forms and sumptuous textures are also typical of the artist's work.  Scholars think it's possible that the complete set of panels once formed a box that held a sacred relic of Saint John the Baptist.  X-rays of the panels show evidence of hardware to support this theory."""
The Nativity,429.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  This is a recent acquisition, it's very difficult today to find high quality paintings by known masters of the Renaissance still in private hands, finding one of this beauty, importance and condition is very rare indeed.  It is a nativity scene painted by the 16th Century master Fra Bartolomeo, a Florentine friar and follower of the religious and political reformer Savonarola.  His devotion as a Christian brother is evident in the sincerity with which he painted this picture, the delicate, almost ethereal profiles of Joseph and the Virgin Mary.  The painting is intimate in scale and feeling, it has a softness, sweetness and purity of response to this holy occasion, the birth of Jesus, it shows the Virgin Mary and Joseph on either side of the baby Jesus in a rustic setting with three diaphanous angels floating above to emphasize the holy nature of the activity below.  Two other angels approach behind the Virgin Mary and in the distance we see a landscape.  The landscape is one we know from drawings by Fra Bartolomeo.  In fact, Fra Bartolomeo made numerous drawings for this painting, drawings of the principal figures, the angels, the landscape, everything.  It was a painting on which the artist labored for a long time even though the beauty and elegance of the result seemed so natural and simple."""
The Assumption of the Virgin,430.mp3,"""Narrator:  In this picture by the great Spanish master El Greco, we see the Virgin Mary ascending into heaven balancing on a sliver of a crescent moon.  Beneath her we see the Apostles who gather around Mary's tomb, they are astonished to find it empty and look to each other in confusion.  The figures communicate a great deal of energy and expression.  There are two distinct moods in the picture, the first captured in the chaos and confusion of the Apostles gathered near the tomb, above, the Virgin and the angels surrounding her wear expressions of heavenly peace and tranquility.  Born in Crete, El Greco lived and worked for a time Italy.  this was the artist's first major commission when he arrived in is adopted home of Spain, it was commissioned for the central panel of the high altar of the convent church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo.  The chapel was being rebuilt to honor a pious widow who had lived in the convent for decades.  A painting depicting the Trinity hung above it and side panels featured other images depicting the saving power of Christ.  Thus, we should imagine this painting surrounded by other pictures, maybe the flicker candlelight, the gold of an altar as part of a complete environment.  El Greco's composition leads us through the narrative of its subject by the emphatic gestures of its gestures.  The pointing finger of the Apostle and Mary's outstretched arms.  In Venice and Rome, El Greco absorbed the late Mannerist style characterized by elongated dramatically twisted figures and elaborate drapery.  And yet, he transformed what we call Mannerism into something transcendent, something highly elegant and rich with sentiment and convincing emotion.  This picture was recommended to the Art Institute by the American Impressionist painter Mary Cassatt.  Besides being a successful artist in her own right, and we have several of her paintings in our American art galleries, she also gave some very good advice to American collectors and to this museum."""
Rinaldo and Armida in Her Garden,431.mp3,"""Narrator:  We are looking at four paintings that comprise a series by the 18th Century Venetian painter, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.  The paintings illustrate a poem by Torquato Tasso called Jerusalem Liberated.  Beginning at the left, the first in the cycle of paintings was given to us in bequest by James Deering.  The Art Institute's collection is the result of this kind of extraordinary philanthropy.  The painting is of the highest quality, not only is there balance and color between the red and the blue of Rinaldo in the lower right but also in the secondary colors of off yellow and salmon pink and off green of Armida in the upper left.  The bolder colors are given to the heroic male figure and the more pastel colors to the more beautiful and erotic female figure.  According to the story, Rinaldo is resting with his armor and shield en route to the Holy Land to fight in the Crusades against the expansion of Islam into the lands held dear by the Christian populous of Europe and he is distracted en route by the beauty of Armida who visits him in a dream and casts a spell on him causing him to fall in love with her.  This cycle of paintings once decorated a palace in Venice, they were designed to tell a narrative tale as a backdrop for cultured occasions and therefore there must be a rhythm to the series from one picture to the next, a kind of sinuous extended composition.  In the last painting in the series, Rinaldo had landed in the Holy Lands and is being shown his shield by a magician and he's gazing at the heroic deeds of his ancestors for inspiration.  The other two figures are his fellow soldiers coaxing him back into the boat to depart.  Notice the delicate play of light in these pictures, this is the legacy of Venetian pictures going back to the 15th Century.  You might also notice the opulent fabrics, the velvets, silks and brocades that billow around the figures.  The trade of cloth was an important part of life in Venice, it had been a port for centuries for the trade of luxury goods like richly colored velvet fabrics and also glass."""
Bust of Paris,433.mp3,"""Narrator: In this work by the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova we see a sense of simplicity and compositional solidity testifying to a period taste for the architectural grandeur of the classical past which we've come to call Neoclassicism.  Neoclassicism was inspired by works from antiquity, this is evident in both the style and the subject of the works.  In the case of Canova's sculpture, the figure of Paris from Greek mythology.  Canova captures the moment in which the handsome young man turns his head to look at the three graces, the three beauties represented in this myth.  Paris has been called upon by Zeus to decide which among them is the most beautiful.  He chooses Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love because she promises him the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Troy of Sparta.  Canova captures the moment just before his fateful decision.  The style of this sculpture carved in marble suggests a kind of permanence and timelessness that is counter to the fleetingness of the moment it depicts, its hardness as sculpture has been enveloped in this kind of dreamy reflection on the past rather than being this past thing itself.  There's a kind of softness that suggests reflection of thinking back on something rather than the thing itself of a kind of longing for the legitimacy of antiquity.  Canova was an international artist of the late 18th and early 19th Century.  Among his admirers were Napoleon and his wife Josephine.  He made this work as a token of friendship for Antoine Quatremère de Quincy, a leading art critic and theorist of Neoclassicism.  Quatremère reportedly liked the sculpture very much.  It was also admired by the Empress Josephine who commissioned a full length version of the same subject."""
Tall Figure,434.mp3,"""Narrator: This figure by the Swiss painter and sculptor Alberto Giacometti is monumental, taller than life size and yet feels like something one might move about on a game board, it has a totemic presence, one senses a connection to Greek kouroi and heavy feet, the rigid posture, the frontality and impressive height.  Giacometti is playing with scale here, the space between things, even as you stand close to the sculpture, it appears like a silhouette scene from a distance due to its gaunt length.  The rough surface looks as if it has been pushed, pinched, scratched and scooped in order to give it this extraordinary texture.  Although it is made of bronze, it looks like earth or rock.  Throughout his life Giacometti maintained ties to his home in Switzerland, he came from a small town called Stampa in an Italian speaking part of Switzerland known for its rugged mountain peaks.  He returned to Stampa at least once a year making drawings and paintings of the valley where he had grown up in the shadow of the mountains.  Although his sculpture is not a direct evocation of the landscape, the tension between near and far, the scale and rough surface all draw on the visual experience of such an environment.  Giacometti lived in Paris in the 1920s and '30s where he was closely identified with the European surrealists, he counted Tzara [ph?] among his good friends.  He spent most of the Second World War in a tiny hotel room in Geneva whittling his figures down until they were so tiny they would fit in a matchbox or sometimes crumble into dust.  The sculpture you see here was made after the war had ended and he had returned to his Paris studio.  He was a sophisticated intellectual, very much a part of the Parisian avant-garde and yet there is something very old about this work, it seems to have been pulled from the ashes of a destroyed civilization as if from the terrible volcanic dust of Pompeii, a relic of the past rediscovered."""
The Old Guitarist,435.mp3,"""Narrator: Pablo Picasso lived and worked in his studio called the Bateau-Lavoir in a poor district of Paris around the time he made this picture.  He would have seen mendicants like this gaunt man in the streets surrounding his studio.  As a young man filled with the physical and emotional energies of youth, coming to Paris for the first time, full of artistic ambition, he could not have been blind to the evidence of the frailty of life around him.  One wants to see in this arrangement of seemingly broken anatomical forms, the body of Christ being taken down from the cross and no doubt as a Spanish painter from an intensely Catholic country, those references were not far from Picasso's experience.  The young Picasso would also have been familiar with the work of Spanish masters.  Here, his use of white highlights to emphasize the planes of the skull and the expressiveness of the facial features calls to mind El Greco, an important Spanish painter and someone to whom modern painters looked from Cezanne to Picasso.  So while the young Picasso was certainly taking in the work of his avant-garde contemporaries, he is also recalling the traditions culturally and pictorially of his Spanish homeland.  As you look at a work of art and glance at the label for information about the title of the painting and for the name of the artist and dates, you should also look at the credit line.  In this case, you'll see that this picture came from the Helen Birch Bartlett collection.  To hear more about this extraordinary gift to the Art Institute, press play on your audio guide."""
Untitled (Butterfly Habitat),436.mp3,"""Narrator: Joseph Cornell made evocative sculptures from found objects creating these small boxes that seem to be repositories of his imagination, they function as a kind of residue of memory.  He collected ordinary objects, invested with no intrinsic value of their own that he could then bring together to create these haunting and mysterious environments.  In this case, the butterfly habitat is almost like a traditional butterfly habitat is almost like a traditional butterfly collection with the butterflies pinned to the walls behind frosted glass paneled windows.  They seem imprisoned in these boxes, frozen in time and in this case literally frozen because it would seem as if there is ice formed on the glass windows of this box.  Many of Cornell's boxes communicate a sense of time past, decay and even death, these objects are much more personal than the paintings around us in the galleries, they are very intimate, they are so small, you almost have to hold them in your hand to look at them and it almost suggests you can shake them and move them and recreate these little worlds within.  Surrealism plays an important role in the history of collecting in Chicago, the deep and sustained interest of Chicago collectors in the years following World War II may have to do in part with the influence of European immigrants to Chicago and the dealers working in this area at the time.  Thanks to collectors like Lindy and Edwin Bergman, the Art Institute is particularly strong in its holdings of Surrealist art.  If you'd like to hear Lindy Bergman talk about their collection, you can listen to the gallery overview for this area."""
Near the Lagoon,437.mp3,"""Narrator: This painting by Jasper Johns is called Near the Lagoon.  It was painted on Saint Martin's Island in the Caribbean, home to the artist's studio.  There is something suggestive of the humidity and languid character of a warm seaside setting.  Johns used one of his favorite media encaustic in which the color pigment is suspended in wax, the wax mutes the color and deepens its effect and seems to underscore the muted emotional tenor of the painting.  We can imagine that the painting was painted in a studio with windows looking out onto the water onto the actual lagoon.  The striations of color that slash on the surface of the painting, some greens, yellows, reds suggest slashing rain on the surface of a window, a window that might even be frosted up by the humidity of a hot day like the soft grey of the picture's waxy surface.  Notice the string draped across the surface attached to wooden hinged dowels or slats, the strings stands off the surface of the painting and moves slightly with the flow of air in the gallery, like a hammock or a clothesline suspended from trees swinging lazily in the humid air of a southern garden.  This painting derives from a painting by the 19th Century French painter Édouard Manet.  Manet's painting, The Execution of Maximilien was inspired by the execution of the Habsbourg Emperor of Mexico by Mexican rebels.  Manet was never happy with his painting and painted separate versions of the subject.  He actually cut up one version and it was his friend Edgar Degas who gathered up the surviving fragments in an effort to restore it.  That version now hangs in the National Gallery and it is this fragmentary painting that Johns used as the basis for the painting before you.  If you look closely, you can see pieces of cloth beneath the waxy surface of the painting, these are references to Manet's earlier painting.  There is something deeply melancholic about this painting by Jasper Johns, maybe it's the suggestion of the artist's studio, a quiet place of contemplation and art making with the sense of rain slashing against the window, the artist alone in his studio reflecting on his painting, the one before him, this one here and he's thinking of Manet's painting and Manet's unhappiness with that painting.  One can think of this painting as a kind of meditation on the condition of painting, the nagging sense that one can never succeed in painting what one wants to paint in communicating through paint, the meanings and effects one wants to communicate.  Cezanne, one of Johns' favorite painters and a colleague of Manet's never believed he succeeded in painting what he could see in nature.  Painting is a difficult and lonely activity, that sense of labor and anxiety is evident in this picture."""
Lobed Bowl with Seated Figure and Attendants,501.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  A handsome young man holds court at the center of this brilliant bowl.  Two sphinxes bow before him while immediately around him, an endless caravan circles.  The two humps identify the camels as Bactrian from today's Afghanistan.  In the next two registers and on the outside of the bowl, riders gallop energetically.  These horsemen are probably engaged in falconry, in some places you can see that the birds are on leashes.  All the movement runs from right to the left, in the same direction as the inscription on the inside and outside of this bowl's lip.  The procession of camels is closest to the regal figure at the center, suggesting that camels are more important to his wealth, power and prestige than the mounted nobleman.  Camels made the Silk Road possible, beginning around the 2nd Century BCE until the expansion of sea routes in the 16th and 17th Century CE put an end to the great caravans.  These beasts of burden transported people and goods back and forth along the 5,000 miles between Eastern Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.  Over the centuries, fortunes were made and lost, but more important are the extraordinary exchanges of ideas, beliefs and cultural practices that these journeys made possible, these exchanges changed the world and their traces are everywhere around us today.

Reliquary with Tooth of Saint John the Baptist,503.mp3,"""<singing>
Narrator:  This Medieval reliquary is a time capsule of ten centuries and two radically different cultures.  Within the carved crystal mounted in the center, there's a small piece of linen containing the tooth of John the Baptist.  He was the gospel prophet who baptized Jesus Christ.  A crucifix is located at the very top of the reliquary, the spires that rise from the buttresses on either side and the steeply pitched roof of the central chapel are a miniature imitation of the gothic style of church architecture.  The carved crystal began life very differently, it was made in Muslim, Egypt sometime around the end of the first millennium CE.  Although its translucence is ideal for displaying the shrouded tooth within, it was originally intended by its manufacturer to hold perfume.  The object probably made its way to Germany as a result of a bustling Mediterranean trade in the Middle Ages.  Once a secular container made by Muslims to hold an elegant fragrance, it now displays a sacred Christian relic."""
Ewer,505.mp3,"""<music plays>
Narrator:  Like jewelry worn to adorn a beautiful face, this porcelain pouring vessel called a kendi sits within silver mounts fashioned in England.  Blue and white porcelain have been imported from China since the 15th Century.  After this piece arrived in England around 1600, a silversmith added the metal armature to make the ewer more European in design.  The silver mounts protect and enhance the simpler form of the porcelain vessel by adding a scrolled handle, a longer spout, a round base and a hinged lid.  Without the silver handle, it would have been necessary to hold the porcelain kendi by the neck as the Chinese did.  The blue and white kendi was made in China in a period before the Europeans understood how to make porcelain themselves.  The kind of clay used to make such luminous and watertight forms seemed destined to remain a Chinese and later Japanese secret.  But in the early 18th Century, deposits of the white burning clay called kaolin that the Chinese had used were discovered in Germany near the city of Meissen.  Europeans finally had the crucial ingredient to create their own precious porcelain.  Before then, Chinese imports were adapted like this one to suit Western expectations, they could remain beautiful and still serve a practical purpose for the European who wanted to use it."""
Seventeenth-Century Interior,506.mp3,"""Narrator:   A blue and white porcelain vase from China stands on a table covered in a Persian carpet in this still life by American artist Charles Dyer.  These objects display their owner's worldliness and familiarity with Eastern cultures.  Notice how the carpet has been carefully draped over the table in a decorative manner rather than laid flat on the floor.  Dyer titled this painting 17th Century Interior, perhaps an homage to 17th Century Dutch still life painters who often featured similar goods in their paintings.  But Persian carpets and Chinese porcelain remained a desirable commodity in the 19th Century.  By the 1870s, American collectors began to acquire porcelain and carpets as art objects in themselves rather than mere household furnishings.  A native Chicagoan, Dyer first worked as a diplomat in Beirut before becoming an artist, he later lived in Munich where he completed this painting in 1877.  Dyer also spend time working on his art in Syria and Egypt.  Here's Sarah Kelly, Associate Curator of American Art.
Sarah Kelly:  Dyer himself actually travelled extensively and so these are undoubtedly objects that he acquired in his travels.  This could be seen in some ways as almost a self portrait in that it shows his life as he's gathered it together."""
Trompe-l'Oeil Still Life with a Flower Garland and a Curtain,509.mp3,"""Narrator:  If you have an impulse to move the blue curtain further to one side, please resist it, it's actually a painting of a silk curtain by Dutch artist, Franz van Mieris.  Realistically executed in a style known in French as trompe l'oeil or fool the eye.  The curtain if it had been real would have been used in the 17th Century to protect the painting from dust and soot.  Another subtler trick is the choice of flowers painted by a second artist Adriaen von de Velde.  Here's Larry Fineberg.
Larry Fineberg:  To some degree this painting is an example of conspicuous consumption, it's a complete fantasy because it combines flowers not only from various places but also flowers that did not bloom at the same time of year.  
Narrator:  Because of Holland's lucrative maritime trade, the wealthier Dutch could acquire flowers from the East.  Look at the red and white tulip in the lower right hand corner.  Although this flower is closely associated with Holland today, tulips were originally imported from Persia."""
"Tankard (Hanap) with Tulips, Hyacinths, Roses, and Carnations",510.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Roses, hyacinths and tulips describe a graceful rhythm on this tankard. It comes from the celebrated kilns of Iznick near Constantinia [ph?] today’s Istanbul the capital of the far reaching Ottoman Empire. This vessel is made of frit a mixture of clay and ground stone. Frit gives a pure white surface that takes pigments well. Skilled Persian potters developed frit-ware in order to achieve some of the effects possible only with Chinese porcelain whose raw materials and high temperature firing were a mystery and would remain a secret for centuries. The cloud bands along the rim and the base are imported Chinese motifs. The floral ornamentation and under glaze technique derive from Chinese blue and white ceramics but display local blossoms in rich and brilliant colors. That deep red was a sixteenth century innovation that came out of the Iznik kilns. So this tankard was technologically very cutting edge. In the Islamic world flowers and gardens were associated with love poetry and paradise. Carnations flavored sherbets and adorned the official signature of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. In Europe, tulip mania exploded in Holland. When the market in Turkish bulbs crashed in 1637 thousands of families were ruined but the Dutch never lost their affection for these fabulous blooms."""
The Adoration of the Magi,512.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Look towards the center of this round painting attributed to renaissance artist Raffaello Botticini. Nearly lost in this busy colorful scene the Christ child and his mother sit at the foot of a stairway leading underneath the arch of a pagan temple now in ruins. Here’s Larry Feinberg, curator of European painting. 
Larry Feinberg:  The subject has to deal with the adoration of the magi. It’s basically a sort of royal courtesy of the foreign kings coming to visit this new divine king on earth. 
Narrator:  The magi have arrived by this ship that you can see at the upper left of the painting. Among the many people their retinue are several animals associated at the time with the exotic east. Seated on a marble slab in the left foreground is a monkey on a leash. On the far right of the painting, to the left of the red figure on horseback is a giraffe. Look above the giraffe to find a peacock perched on a wooden beam. 
Larry Feinberg:  Peacocks since medieval times were often associated with Christ because it was believed that after it died its flesh never decayed. And so that became a symbol of Christ’s immortality."""
Buddha,513.mp3,"""Narrator:  This solemn and peaceful sculpture from China represents the central figure of the Buddhist faith which traveled from India to China along the Silk Road. The Buddha meditates in the traditional lotus position, a pose that originated in his native Nepal. But his features are Chinese. The historical Buddha was born Siddhārtha Gautama in the sixth century B.C.E. He’s also called Shakyamuni or sage of the Shakya’s because his father was king of the Shakya people. At 29 he became an ascetic and at 35 through mediation he achieved enlightenment or nirvana. The word Buddha means enlightened or awakened one. The Buddha realized that human suffering is caused by the ego’s cravings. In our ignorance we actually choose the painful cycle of attachment and dissatisfaction called samsara. The way to freedom is the noble eight-fold path, that is through practicing right view, intentions, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration. The Sanskrit word dharma comprises the totality of the Buddhist teachings. In his enlightenment the Buddha also experienced his many previous lives. There are, in fact, many Buddhas in both the past and the future. Notice the bump on the sculpture’s head. That’s the ushnisha a symbol of the Buddha’s great knowledge. He also wears no jewelry as a reminder of his asceticism. These two features are typical of representations of the Buddha after his enlightenment. The Buddha you’ve been looking at represents a Chinese interpretation of an Indian style of Buddha sculpture. Now, turn and find the tall black stone tablet on your right near the wall. This is a Buddhist adaptation of an ancient Chinese type of monument. If you’d like to know more about it, please press the play button."""
Shukongojin,514.mp3,"""Janice Katz:  What we’re looking at here is a guardian whose called Shukongojin. 
Narrator:  Janice Katz, assistant curator of Japanese art. 
Janice Katz:  In his right hand, he holds the stylized thunderbolt that’s called a Vajra. And this is to cast down any doubt, any kind of obstacles in the path to enlightenment and to understanding the Buddhist law. 
Narrator:  The sculptor represented the irresistible energy of wisdom and enlightenment as a violent, divine wind. It churns up the tumultuous water at the feet of the enraged scowling figure. It tosses the belt of his animal skin garment and raises the flames on his head. They’re another symbol of enlightenment like the third eye in his forehead. As such Buddhist guardian figures traveled east they were translated into local styles. 
Janice Katz:  This is a period in Japanese Buddhist sculpture when the sense of realism is infused into the figures and you get things like this hyper real musculature with veins popping out and very intense look to the figure’s faces especially in these guardian figures who are supposed to cast fear into the enemies of Buddha.

Camel and Rider,518.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This beautifully glazed ceramic sculpture was crafted for a wealtyh person’s tomb. Take a look at the saddlebag, that monster face with wide eyes and protruding fangs may have been intended to protect the deceased in the afterlife. Here’s Elinor Pearlstein, associate curator of Chinese art at the Art Institute. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  The stance with the head thrown back and the mouth open to bray is absolutely classic.
Narrator:  As ungainly as they were indispensable, camels are also notoriously bad tempered. The Chinese relied on expert central Asian drivers in the caravans plying the trade routes. The foreign groom who rides with the camel wears a Persian or central Asian coat. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  This animal was really the only reliable means of transport across the vast waste of the overland Silk Roads. 
Narrator:  If it weren’t for camels there might not have been a Silk Road. The two humps identify this fine specimen as a Bactrian camel from present day Afghanistan. Bactrian camels can travel thirty miles a day, carry hundreds of pounds and go for more than a week without water. These celebrated ships of the desert can also tolerate very hot and very cold temperatures which allows them to travel across the forbidding deserts and high mountain ranges that extend west out of China."""
Armored Guardian King (Tianwang) Trampling Demon,519.mp3,"""Narrator:  A fierce moustached warrior seems to shout in triumph as a defeated demon writhes under foot. The mighty upward sweep of the overall composition suggests the warrior’s other worldly power. Stylized dragon heads adorn his shoulder guards and his headdress is crowned by a phoenix-like bird. These fanciful details all emphasize the supernatural nature of this figure which was intended to protect the deceased in the afterlife. Guardian figures which appear in Hindu and Buddhist art seem to have accompanied the spread of Buddhism into China along the Silk Road where they encountered similar native traditions. By the time of the Tang dynasty these guardians watched over secular as well as religious grave sites. This fearsome warrior was probably even more terrifying when you first went into the tomb. You can see that his face and his phoenix headdress are unglazed. They were originally painted creating a dramatic contrast. A spear or other weapon in his left hand would have definitely frightened off any evil spirits or human intruders."""

It’s almond or eye shape makes the sound die away quickly as opposed to round bells which have a sustained ring. Now, look for a band of abstract designs in low relief. Striking the outside of the bell with a mallet in the center of the decorated section produces a note or tone in one musical scale. Striking the outer edge produces a different tone higher in pitch. A round bell sounds the same no matter where it’s struck. Finally, the raised spiral baoses [ph?] may mute diffuse vibrations giving the notes a crisp quality."""

Winged Beast (Tomb Figure),522.mp3,"""Narrator:  What we’re looking at here is a composite animal. You can see that it has both wings and scales while its body looks like a mammal’s. Western scholars have often speculated about where intriguing mythical beasts like this one originated. But no one really knows for sure. Likewise, no one knows for sure what this imagery beast signified. It may have been meant to keep away evil influences but it’s certainly more engaging than confrontational. We do know how this likeable little creature functioned. It was probably one of a pair. Each creature held a vertical post in the square hole at the base of the neck. The two posts were joined by a cross piece. Suspended from the cross piece were clay bells or chimes. These surrogate instruments imitating bronze bells and stone chimes were undoubtedly two fragile to be played. Their music was obviously designed to resound only in the afterlife. In earlier times the prototypes of this clay sculpture were made of costly bronze and buried in the tombs of the aristocracy. By the Han period, that is the first two centuries B.C.E., when this one was made clay replicas were largely mass produced to satisfy the demand for burial goods by an expanding middle class."""
Entertainer (Tomb Figure),523.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This stout figure seems to depict a central Asian entertainer in the act of balancing something on his forehead. In fact, if you look from above you’ll see that the forehead is pierced with a hold that would have supported a stick or pole now lost. Notice how realistically the artist described this figure’s stance as he tries to keep the pole balanced. In the sixth century C.E. when this lively sculpture was made large areas of north China were occupied and divided by a succession of central Asian peoples. Artists and artisans were inspired by the ever changing panorama of unfamiliar faces they saw around them, diplomats, merchants, religious clerics and here entertainers. The craftsman whether a native Chinese or a foreigner working in China seems to have engaged in good natured exaggeration of foreign features. Neither the proportions of his body nor his features nor his clothes are Chinese. This figure was probably buried in the tomb of an official of a foreign court, undoubtedly to entertain the deceased in the afterlife. Large areas of China were often under non-Chinese rule. Invariably, the foreign rulers exposed China to outside influences. At the same time, most foreigners themselves gradually adopted Chinese customs, language and many styles of dress.

When this dish was made, China was ruled by the Mongols, nomadic tribesmen from Mongolia and present day Manchuria. The Mongol’s vast empire stretched westward across China through central Asia, much of present day Russia and west to the Caspian and Black Seas including present day Iran and Iraq. Under the Mongol rulers, Chinese ceramics like this were often made to order for foreign markets. The bracketed rim, for example, is inspired by Middle Eastern metal work while the magnified view of a bird in a garden setting surrounded by the decorative floral designs is more in keeping with Middle Eastern than with Chinese taste. The design isn’t the only innovation. At about this time, the fourteenth century under glaze painting with cobalt blue began to transform the history of Chinese ceramics. The blue ore was brought from Persia along the Silk Road and is sometimes known as Mohammedan blue. The brilliance of the pigment is enhanced by the technique of overlaying a clear glaze over the painted body. Sharing large platters of food is an Islamic custom. The name Hasan ibn Mohammed inscribed in ink on the back of the dish is written Arabic script. We don’t know, however, whether this style of porcelain dish was made for export or produced for an Islamic client living in China.

Funerary Urn (Hunping),526.mp3,"""Narrator:  Notice the meticulous details on this funerary urn called a soul jar. A prosperous house forms the lid. Below it are storage baskets, utensils and attendants, everything necessary to be comfortable in the afterlife. So you can take it with you. 
<music>
Jay Xu:  Not only you can take it with you, you can take more than you had with you because by image making you’re really entering into a realm of unlimited possibilities. 
Narrator:  That’s Jay Xu, Pritzker Curator of Asian Art. Just above the urn’s shoulders find the pointed vertical element supported by a turtle. Then look for the third figure to the left behind a shield. The bump of enlightenment on his head, the ushnisha identifies him as an enlightened Buddha. In the third century C.E. Buddhist images were just entering China along the Silk Road. 
Jay Xu:  The first step is always the transfer of the images, images that are carried by very concrete artifacts. The foreign deities were understood probably as a magical figure possessive of extra power. 
Narrator:  The Buddhist view that life is suffering seems incompatible with traditional Chinese beliefs about the afterlife. However, the concept of rebirth which extends life after death permitted Buddhism to become fully absorbed into Chinese culture. Over the centuries, Buddhism would radically effect Chinese social structures, politics and art."""
Maitreya Buddha (Mi-le),527.mp3,"""Narrator:  What stillness elements from this figure?  Here’s Pritzker curator of Asian art Jay Xu. 
Jay Xu:  His name is Maitreya. And in Chinese transcription since this Buddha image was made in China is called the Mi-Lo [ph?]. 
Narrator:  Buddhism traveled east along the trade routes to China from present day India. Mi-Lo is both a Buddha and a bodhisattva. The bump on his head, the ushnisha, manifests the energy of the Buddha’s meditation but like a bodhisattva Mi-Lo is ready to step down into our world to help us achieve enlightenment and liberation from the painful cycle of life, death and rebirth. He rests his feet on lotus blossoms that grow out of the stem between them. 
Jay Xu:  Part of the reason why lotuses were so important, so potent symbol in Buddhism because it emerge unsullied from muddy water, still possess its purity. 
Narrator:  The halo behind Mi-Lo’s head is lotus shaped too. The inscription on the base tells us who commissioned the statue and the date it was made. The date is given in a system known as heavenly stems and earthly branches. To hear about this ancient Chinese calendar, please press the play button."""
Head of a Luohan,528.mp3,"""<music>
Jay Xu:  This wonderful figure has an Indian name Arhat. In Chinese it’s called aluohan. It’s a Chinese transliteration of an Indian term. 
Narrator:  Jay Xu, Pritzker curator of Asian Art. Arhat’s or aluohan’s were the original disciples of the Buddha. 
Jay Xu:  It’s most remarkable for its lifelikeness and very, very strong sense of a realism and also a wonderful sense of the moment. 
Narrator:  This really is a speaking likeness. He might be about to give a sermon or perhaps he’s chanting to achieve enlightenment. Take a look at his neck. The tear reveals the underlying fabric on which the artisan applied layers of lacquer a very toxic substance when liquid. The core, perhaps of clay, would have been modeled from life perhaps from a monk. This bust was probably once part of a very impressive life size figure. The portrait like quality of the aluohan’s features reminds us that it was, after all, individuals who traveled the Silk Road and who brought with them their beliefs about the world along with artistic styles and commercial goods.

Buddha Sheltered by the Serpent King Muchalinda,530.mp3,"""Narrator:  The Buddha meditates serene and smiling. The lotus flower which emerges pure white from impure mud is an essential Buddhist symbol. You can see one incised in the palm of his right hand. The Buddha sits on the powerful coils of the many-headed serpent king Mucalinda whose hoods form a halo. 
Tanya Treptow:  After the Buddha’s enlightenment he mediated over a period of several weeks and during this time there is a very violent thunderstorm and the serpent king Mucalinda came and sheltered the Buddha with his hoods so that he would be able to meditate. 
Narrator:  Tanya Treptow, research assistant in the areas of southeast Asian, Indian and Islamic art.
Tanya Treptow:  This figure represents a form that was vastly popular during the Khmer Empire. 
Narrator:  The extensive Khmer Empire centered in today’s Cambodia was near the end of a long period of prosperity in the thirteenth century when this sculpture was made. In this period, Khmer kings officially adopted Buddhism and sponsored many new temples and sculptures. You can follow Buddhism’s journey from India to Cambodia in this sculpture. For example, the usually unadorned Buddha here where’s the crown of a Khmer prince. It may be that the patron of this kingly sculpture wished to suggest the Buddha’s approval of the Khmer dynasty."""
"Four-Armed Sarasvati, Goddess of Learning, Seated in Lotus Position (Padmasana)",532.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Deep in timeless meditation the goddess Saraswati sits on her lotus throne. Her multiple arms express her power. She is the goddess of learning. You can see a book in her lower left hand. In her upper right hand is an animal prod called a goad. That’s a noose in her upper left hand. Both of these objects are used to train elephants. But they also have spiritual meanings. The goad symbolizes wisdom and the noose stands for mindfulness. Together, they remind the goddess’s devotees of the discipline necessary to achieve spiritual progress. Take a look at the top of the sculpture just about Saraswati’s crown. See if you can make out two bulging eyes above two stylized cheeks. That’s the so called “face of glory”. It’s an apotropaic image. That is, it’s designed to keep away evil. This sculpture is from Karnataka, India, home of some of the oldest known Hindu temples. But the very ornate carving on this sculpture is typical of thirteenth century Jain temples. In fact, the wise Saraswati is revered by practitioners of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, three of the world’s oldest known belief systems.

Vasudhara Offering Mandala,533.mp3,"""Tanya Treptow:  This object is a mandala. 
Narrator:  Here’s Tanya Treptow, research assistant in the areas of Southeast Asian, Indian, and Islamic art. 
Tanya Treptow:  The mandala is an important symbol of the Buddhist religion. It’s basically a cosmogram of the heavenly realm and the earthly realms. It’s a symbol of the order and the harmony of the way that Buddhists imagined the divine realm and the state of the enlightened mind as well. 
<music>
Narrator:  The many armed goddess Ushnisha Vijaya, a Buddhist deity of long life, sits at the center. Ushnisha Vijaya’s name is related to the ushnisha the topknot behind her crown. It signifies her enlightenment. You can also see a small vessel which he holds to her body in one of her lower hands. This is a vase of good fortune and longevity filled with ambrosia. Outside the largest square you can see four majestic architectural gates that open to the cardinal directions north, south, east and west. The three round levels and the five square steps that form the mandala symbolize Buddhism’s eightfold path to enlightenment. You can perform a kind of virtual pilgrimage by imagining yourself making your way towards Ushnisha Vijaya’s shrine at the center.

Tile with Double-Arched Prayer Niche (Mihrab),535.mp3,"""Narrator:  The arched panels on this splendid thirteenth century tile are more than decoration. They’re an essential element of Islamic religion, the mihrab. The mihrab is the niche in a mosque, shrine, or mausoleum that indicates the direction of Mecca, the city in present day Saudi Arabia, towards which observant Muslims pray five times daily. This tile, which probably came from a tomb, is unique because it has two niches instead of the usual one. The decoration is made up almost entirely of raised calligraphy. Although this tile was made and used in Iran where people spoke Persian, the inscriptions are written in Arabic. There from chapters called surahs of the Islamic holy book the Koran. Islam accords great significance to the Arabic language because it was in Arabic that God, through the angel Gabriel, conveyed his holy message to the prophet Mohammed in the seventh century C.E.  That message was written down as Koran. Calligraphy is highly respected in Islamic society as a form of high art. Calligraphy appears in numerous mediums from architecture to manuscripts and carpets. Tile work with Koranic verses similar to this example could be found throughout the Islamic world from Spain to Central Asia. The inscription above the niches is from Surah 55. It reads, “Everyone must pass away and there will endure forever the countenance of your Lord.”"""
Planispheric Astrolabe,536.mp3,"""Narrator:  Take moment to explore this intricate and beautiful computer called an astrolabe. 
<music>
Narrator:  The various moving parts allow you to determine your exact position and the hour. These calculations were most useful when traveling at sea or across the desert. The inscription at the top of the astrolabe is probably a pious dedication, perhaps a quotation from the Koran. Islamic religious practice, summarized as the five pillars of Islam, requires the faithful to pray five times a day in the direction of Mecca in today’s Saudi Arabia. Using an astrolabe an observant Muslim could determine the correct time and orientation for prayers. Beginning in the eighth century Islamic merchants traveled as far west as Spain, as far north as Sweden and as far East as China. Islamic ships sailed the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf but also plied the Indian Sea, and ventured as far as the sea the Chinese called the Ocean of Great Peace, or the Pacific Ocean.

Horse and Rider,538.mp3,"""Narrator:  From the twelfth through the sixteenth century the powerful kingdom of Mali extended over a large portion of northern West Africa protected by warriors mounted on horseback. The kingdom’s great wealth and influence grew from its strategic position controlling the northward flow of valuable goods including gold and slaves in exchange for salt, copper and manufactured wares. The mountain man in this group is larger than the rest indicating his superior status. Even today, images of mounted warriors are important symbols of power in modern Mail which draws its name from the ancient kingdom. This group of terracotta figures was probably made between the fourteen and fifteenth centuries. Their fluid sculptural style is called Bancone after a village near Bamako, Mali’s present day capital where similar figures were unearthed. The individuals are clearly wealthy and their rich details of dress offer a fascinating glimpse into Mali’s medieval past. Their hair is carefully styled. Their enormous bracelets would have been made of gold or brass. The mounted warrior wears a pendant at his neck and what are probably bells suspended from his belt. He and the seated warrior to the right wear knives on their upper arms. If you look behind the seated warrior you can see the quiver he wears on his back.

Oinochoe (Pitcher),539.mp3,"""Narrator:  If you look at the top three rows of animals depicted on the side of this wine pitcher you can see here and there an animal with a raised head. Its tail is curled across its back, its mouth agape. This creature is a lion. The picture was made in the Greek city-state of Corinth in the seventh century B.C.E. But the Corinthian artist who created these animal figures had probably never seen a lion in person. He copied it from art imagery that had migrated from the East. Prior to this so-called Orientalizing period, Greek phases tended to have mostly geometric designs. The introduction of animal and human forms occurred as trade increased between East and West. Located along a narrow strip of land on the Aegean Sea Corinth was a major hub of sea trade. This exposure and contact between two worlds revolutionized the way Greek artists depicted their world."""
Pair of Protomes Depicting the Forepart of a Griffin,540.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This pair of griffin heads was once part of a group that circled the rim of an ancient cauldron. The Greeks used cauldrons as gifts to their gods and goddesses. Look closely at the base of each bronze head where the edge flares out from the neck. You can still see the remnants of rivets that once attached each griffin to the cauldron. The most prominent rivet is on the upper left edge of the right griffin. The griffin has the head of a bird and the body of a lion. It was known in Greek mythology for being a fierce guardian of gold. Although the legend of the griffin migrated from the East into Greece little is known about its origin. Recent research, however, suggests that this ancient story may have been inspired by the fossil remains of a dinosaur found at the base of the Altai Mountains at the western border of modern Mongolia. The dinosaur called the protoceratops has a beak like a griffin and four legs like a feline. The Altai Mountains themselves are known for their gold deposits. Is it possible that prehistoric travelers of the Silk Road who discovered the fossil near the gold combined the two to create this legend of the griffin?"""
Teapot,541.mp3,"""Narrator:  From the scrolls of foliage along the body and neck to the scalloped rows of fan shapes at the end of the spout, the entire surface of this silver teapot is covered with decoration. This abundance of detail was inspired in part by the esthetic movement of the late nineteenth century. Although this movement’s ideals rejected the excessive use of detail, ornamentation was still highly valued in the design of beautiful and functional objects. The stylized elements on this teapot convey a luxurious yet refined harmony of form and shape. The esthetic movement also inspired a fascination with Eastern or otherwise exotic designs. This teapot manufactured in America by the whiting company was considered Moorish at the time. The word Moorish conjures the Muslim culture of Spain and North Africa, but very few of the details on the teapot are strictly Muslim in design. Just as Westerners imagined Japanese art as being spare and simple they thought Moorish art should be dense and elaborate. What appeared to be exotic was not always truly Eastern. The result was a shorthand of design elements that merely suggested the East."""
Server,542.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  From a distance, this piece of wood furniture may look like any serving table kept in a dining room. Its basic design is essentially Western but up close, the elaborate tracery reveals a tropical pattern. Look carefully at the top corners of the square front panels. You can see the heads of palm trees emerging from the dense symmetry of vines, leaves, and flowers. The panels themselves were made in western Indian. American designer and artist Lockwood de Forest employed local Indian woodworkers to copy these designs from the details of Indian architecture. From India, the panels were shipped to New York where they were assembled into Western style furniture and sold. They catered to a taste for so called oriental designs among wealthier American patrons in the 1880s and 1890s. But even though de Forest capitalized on this demand, he had other reasons for being interested in the Indian crafts movement. Here’s Sarah Kelly.
Sarah Kelly:  Indian craftsmanship seemed to be on the wane and he was saddened by that fact. And so part of his purpose, as he saw it, was to reestablish Indian traditional carving as a marketable practice."""
Punch Bowl,543.mp3,"""Narrator:  The central flag on the side of this punch bowl is American. To the left is a British flag and to the right a Dutch flag. If you look closely you’ll notice that there are only thirteen stars in the upper left corner of the American flag. At the time this bowl was made in China around 1800 America had fewer than 20 states in the Union. The wharf and factory buildings depicted on the side of this bowl are in Canton, China along the Pearl River Delta. In 1784 the newly independent nation of America joined the long established China trade in teas, spices, silks and porcelain. Here’s Sarah Kelly. 
Sarah Kelly:  Since they weren’t allowed into the country itself, all of the traders would come in and dock their ships outside of these factories. And then Chinese traders would come to them and the exchange would happen. 
Narrator:  The punch bowl was possibly manufactured for the American market and may have been shipped to Boston although there’s no way to know this for sure. Boston was a relatively young city at this time and one that grew and prospered thanks, in part, to trading relations with the East."""
Sideboard,544.mp3,"""Narrator:  When English designer William Godwin created this sideboard in the late nineteenth century contemporary decorative taste usually called for more elaborate ornament. His design was unique in its simplicity with slender lines articulating the spaces between cabinets. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  Because of the stock geometry of the piece, the linearity, it was pure form rather than overstuffed and overloaded and over decorated. 
Narrator:  That was Ghenete Zelleke, curator of European decorative arts. Godwin’s artistic appreciation for the grid like arrangement of Japanese design influenced the structure of this side board. But this lightweight piece also has practical advantages. Notice the ample space around the legs. 
Ghenete Zelleke:  He abhorred dust and dirt collecting under furniture and that’s a reason why he lifted the side board so far off the floor so that it would be easy to clean underneath it. 
Narrator:  Structurally the cabinet is made in two parts with the upper half fitted into the long horizontal plane of the sideboard. In addition, the side panels at the level of the desk could be lowered or raised according to need. Such flexibility permitted the piece to be displayed in variously sized rooms. In Godwin’s sideboard beauty and function combine elegantly."""
The Interior of the Palm House on the Pfaueninsel Near Potsdam,547.mp3,"""Narrator:  This splendid greenhouse may look of a Raj’s palace in India but it was actually built in Germany for King Wilhelm III. Notice the four women in Eastern dress lounging around the base of the center column.  Gloria Groom is curator of European painting. 
Gloria Groom:  It’s this mixture of reality with fantasy. These women are probably inspired by an Indian play that had been performed in 1821 at court. The architecture itself evokes Indian temples. So you have this wonderful sense of being there with this real garden and these theatrical figures who kind of evoke harem women, enslaved concubines. 
Narrator:  Painter Carl Blechen had never traveled outside of Europe but his background in the theater and his imagination of the exotic East combined to create this staged oriental fantasy. Now, look above the women and notice the sky silhouettes of palm fronds looming in the foreground. Again, Gloria Groom. 
Gloria Groom:  What I love most about it is that you have these great palm trees which, of course, would not grow naturally in Germany. And I’m sure for the Germans in nineteenth century it was astonishing to see these kinds of plants on their own terrain."""
Bust of Said Abdullah of the Darfour People,548.mp3,"""Narrator:  The exquisite details in these two busts demonstrate the artist Charles Cordier’s desire to capture the exact appearance of the East African man known as Said Abdullah and unknown African woman. Notice the diagonal patterns of fabric design faintly scored across the folds of the woman’s wrapped gown. The male bust is also finely detailed. At the figure’s neckline you can see the individual strands of the tassels that adorn his cloak. Cordier’s precision had as much to do with the mid-nineteenth century interest in ethnology as it did with sheer artistry. As the official ethnographic sculptor to the museum of natural history in Paris Cordier meant to use his art as a way of documenting foreign cultures, tribes and races in an era of colonial occupation. On the other hand, these two busts were celebrated for their universal qualities of beauty. When the male bust of Said Abdullah appeared in the Paris salon of 1848, the exhibition catalog remarked upon the nobility of his expression and compared it to a Roman emperor. The bust of the woman was originally titled in English, “African Venus” a name that conjures a mythic European idea of perfect beauty as well as the subject’s African origins."""

The Combat of Giahour and Hassan,549.mp3,"""Narrator:  Two men of different religious faiths attack one another on horseback in this dramatic scene. Painter Eugène Delacroix called this “The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan” after a poem written by Lord Byron. The man on the right is the Muslim Hassan. On the left an unnamed Giaour or Christian is about to thrust his knife. The Giaour has ambushed Hassan in retaliation for the murder of his lover Leila. Leila had belonged to Hassan’s harem but had been lured away by the Giaour. For her betrayal she was thrown in a sack and drowned by Hassan. This painting captures the moment of Hassan’s death as described in these lines taken from Byron’s poem.
Male Narrator:  “His breast with wings on numbered riven, his back to earth, his face to heaven. Fallen Hassan lies. His unclosed eye yet lowering on his enemy as if the hour that sealed his fate surviving left his quenchless hate.”
Narrator:  Delacroix and Byron were artists who romanticized and exaggerated the otherness of the Eastern Muslim. This characterization perpetuated the idea of the Muslim as a ruthless and lawless figure, an image and both fascinated and alarmed Europeans in the early nineteenth century."""
The Bedroom,550.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  As you look at this painting by artist Vincent van Gogh notice there are no shadows cast by the chairs, bed and table. Without the shadows the furniture seems to hover and push towards your eyes rather than be planted firmly on the floor. To this bright shadow-less scene Van Gogh applies pure colors surrounded by thick contour. These techniques used to flatten the perspective of this bedroom are based on lessons he learned from his own collection of Japanese woodblock or ukiyo-e prints. Gloria Groom, curator of European painting. 
Gloria Groom:  But what he loved about the culture and art of Japan was its simplicity. It’s subjects from humble life. He’s really thinking about what the Japanese did in their art and, yet, he’s making it his own. 
Narrator:  This colorful view on van Gogh’s bedroom in the French town of Arles represents a uniquely happy period of his life. He anticipated the arrival of his friend the artist Paul Gauguin and hoped the two would share what he called the yellow house. Although, they would eventually quarrel and separate this painting with its bold flat colors found in Japanese prints captures the artist’s brighter expectations.

Water Lily pond,551.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  From a surrounding riot of willows and reeds a footbridge arches across a waterlily pond. With its dense vegetation and lack of human presence, this garden may seem uncultivated. But it had been carefully crafted by the artist Claude Monet specifically for its function as a painting subject. He even went so far as diverting a nearby river in order to freshen the water of the pond. Monet’s early interest in Japanese art from woodblock prints to ornamental fans gradually gave way to a greater appreciation for their way of seeing nature. Although, his garden north of Paris in the town of Giverny included a variety of domestic flowers, he paid special attention to the Japanese elements of the footbridge and the water lilies. Here’s Gloria Groom, curator of European painting. 
Gloria Groom:  What’s wonderful about this is this is sort of the culmination of his interest in Japanese art which begins very early in his career, its private, and it's all about what he has not only created but now chosen to paint.

Statuette of a Female Figure,563.mp3,"""Narrator:  This early bronze age marble sculpture portrays a female figure entirely through geometric shapes and incised lines. Thousands of similar figures have been discovered dating to the third millennium B.C. Here’s Karen Manchester, the museum’s curator of ancient art. 
Karen Manchester:  They appear abstract to us today because they are missing the decoration they once had. They were once brightly painted with faces, sometimes necklaces, hair. 
Narrator:  Scholars called these Cycladic figures after the islands where they were found southeast of Greece, a circular archipelago in the Aegean Sea known as the Cyclades. Most Cycladic figures are female nudes like this one suggesting a symbolic link to fertility. 
Karen Manchester:  We don’t know their original function. Very few of them have been found in an original context except for a group that was reportedly found in a hoard on the island of Keros where they were broken and buried. We do know that many of them were painted and we do find evidence on some of them of repainting. So we do think that on the basis of the repainting that they probably did have a function during the owner’s lifetime. But what it was we just simply don’t know."""
Belly-Amphora (Storage Jar),564.mp3,"""Narrator:  This storage jar with two handles is called an amphora from the Greek words meaning to carry with both. Mary Greuel spoke in the gallery about the painted scene on this amphora. 
Mary Greuel:  Greek iconography is all about being able to see the accouterments and the things that the figures are holding and what they’re wearing and what kind of situations are depicted. So in this case we’re able to see Heracles. We know him as the hero. And he is often represented with Athena who is seen on the right. She is the goddess of war. 
Narrator:  The figure on the right painted white is Athena. She wears a plumed helmet and holds a warrior’s shield with a rooster in its center. In front of her, we see Heracles killing the Nemean lion, the first of his mythic twelve labors. 
Mary Greuel:  On Greek vases the figures are depicted in either a black or a red. At certain periods they did use additional colors and this face preserves some of the white paint which was added on to the face. The figures of the two women are painted white. This is a convention of showing women with white skin. There is also additional color which is overlaid which is sort of a purple brown and you can see it in some of the cases of the figures, the use of hair, the use on the female garb."""
Kylix (Drinking Cup),565.mp3,"""Narrator:  This round Athenian vase with the shallow bowel is a drinking vessel called a kylix. Curator Karen Manchester describes a kylix as the ancient equivalent of modern stemware. 
Karen Manchester:  This was a wine cup. This was what used at dinner parties which were largely events for men called a symposium. We think of a symposium as a gathering of people for educational purposes. And, in fact, it does derive from that in the symposium was an event that took place in the evening in somebody’s home where men gathered to discuss politics, news of the day like cocktail hour. People would come together. They’d drink wine and proceed with dinner and then other kinds of social activities thereafter. This particular one has evidence of repairs that were made in antiquity. It obviously got broken in some way and the owner cherished enough to take it to somebody to have a repair made. 
Narrator:  In the handle on the right, you can see a crack with a two holes drilled on either side. 
Karen Manchester:  And that’s where they would have perhaps either used some kind of bronze staple. They might have put some kind of cording through there and sealed it with pitch.

Statue of a Seated Woman,566.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  A seated female figure on a pediment of the acropolis inspired this Roman copy from the second century A.D. The head and arms, now lost, were originally separate pieces fastened to the trunk with cement and dowels. The Romans freely adapted Athenian sculptures of the golden age for a variety of new purposes. This elegantly draped figure sits on a rock rather than a thrown. This suggests that the statute commemorated a goddess or perhaps a deified Roman Empress. Karen Manchester. 
Karen Manchester:  We do know that the Romans were particularly fond of Greek sculpture and many ancient works that were made by Greek artists are lost to us. Many of them were made in bronze which either disintegrated or was melted down for other purposes. But we know an awful lot about how these sculptures look because the Romans adored them to the point that they actually made many copies of them. And I use the term copy very, very, very loosely because they’re not necessarily exact replicas of the works of art. Sometimes they make variations in them to suit their own purposes. It’s one of our particular strengths in our Roman collection is that we do have many pieces that are based on Greek originals."""
Relief of a Falling Warrior,567.mp3,"""Narrator:  Here’s curator Mary Greuel recorded in the gallery. 
Mary Greuel:  This figure is a Roman copy of the second century A.D. The original was created in the fifth century B.C. by one of the great Greek sculptures Phidias. This figure is taken from the shield of Athena Parthenos. There was the great cult statute that Phidias created in the fifth century to honor the goddess Athena. And the shield was carved with a battle scene of the Amazons, a fight between the Amazons and the Greeks. This piece does show the capturing of the classical feeling and the elegance of the figure in the calmness of this warrior who has been wounded. His arm is behind him. And yet, he has this very graceful elegance to his face and to his figure. 
Narrator:  In this Roman copy, the figure of the fallen Greek warrior was taken out of its original context and used alone as a decorative architectural element. To the left of the figure, you’ll see a straight border carved into the stone a remnant of the architecture to which it once belonged. 
Mary Greuel:  This figure was found in the port outside of Athens. So we know that it was a shipment of several of these which were found and they were meant for clients in Rome who had ordered them from Greek sculptors. And the shipment never made it to Rome, sunk. So this particular slab shows the evidence of its long, long time that it spent in the sea with all of the pitting areas worn into the surface of the marble."""
Loutrophoros (Container for Bath Water),568.mp3,"""Narrator:  The Greek name for this tall vessel with serpentine handles, loutrophoros, comes from the words meaning washing water and to carry. Loutrophoroi held water for ritual cleansing on one of two occasions: the marriage of a young woman or the burial of unmarried youth of either sex. The red figure paintings on the front show a bride and several attendants preparing for the wedding ceremony. The attendants hold ritual bridal paraphernalia including mirrors, a fan, jewelry, garlands, oil and small boxes called cistas that held ritual implements. The scene on the back, which may be difficult to see, depicts women visiting a young woman’s tomb reemphasizing the dual associations of a loutrophoros. Athens dominated the manufacture of red figure vases in the late sixth and fifth centuries B.C.; then the center of ceramic production in the Mediterranean shifted to southern Italy. This loutrophoros from around 365 B.C. originated in Apulia a Greek settlement in the so-called “heel” of Italy."""
Hand Mirror,570.mp3,"""Narrator:  You’re looking at the back of a solid bronze mirror. The reflective surface is on the other side. Here on the back, you see an engraved female figure with wings cradling the nude lifeless body of a warrior. This represents Ēōs goddess of the dawn holding her son Memnon, a causality of the Trojan War. This episode from Greek mythology had a strong appeal for the Etruscan people including the owner of this mirror. The Etruscan civilization flourished in central Italy particularly during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. 
Karen Manchester:  What we see now is a sort of green/blue surface at one point was a very shiny bronze. 
Narrator:  Curator Karen Manchester. 
Karen Manchester:  They were masters of bronze working and they also had an intense interest in all things Greek and were quite interested in importing large number of works of art from Greece, in particular, Greek vases. What we have preserved is the bronze part of the mirror but it did once have an elaborate handle made in some other material that is now lost, perhaps ivory, bone of some sort, wood, some other material. But the tang that you see at the bottom once was a bit longer and it was inserted into this handle. Sometimes hand mirrors of this sort had a figure at the base that might have been on a stand itself so that the mirror could actually sit on something like the ancient version of a dressing table."""
Statue of Meleager,573.mp3,"""Narrator:  A Roman sculptor of the first century B.C. made this marble copy of a fourth century B.C. statue. The original is attributed to Greek master sculptor and architect Scopas. Together with Praxiteles, Scopas helped to define the late classical era in Greek sculpture. In particular, he established emotional expression as a theme in art. This nude figure’s cloak thrown over the left arm adds a note of restlessness to the figure. The statue portrays Meleager a mighty hunter in Greek mythology. The tall stump beside the figure may allude to Meleager’s fate to die when a particular log was burned. Most probably the sculptor added it to support the heavy marble figure. The original by Scopas showed the hero leaning on his spear with the head of the Caledonian boar on a stump to his left.

Statue of the Aphrodite of Knidos,574.mp3,"""Narrator:  Karen Manchester is the museum’s curator of ancient art. 
Karen Manchester:  Numerous copies of the Aphrodite of Knidos has survived from Roman time. We don’t have the original statue which was made in the fourth century B.C. by an artist named Praxiteles. And the people of Knidos purchased the statue and displayed it in a temple that was located sort of high on the island and it could be seen from distance by sailors on boats. And it was enormously popular in antiquity. It made quite a sensation in its own time because it was the representation of a goddess completely bereft of clothing which was something that was a very daring scheme on the part of Praxiteles. It was very risky of him to have done so. 
Narrator:  The Aphrodite of Knidos ranks as the first nude female sculpture in classical Greek art. 
Karen Manchester:  But it became one of the most popular sculptures among the Romans but not for placement in a temple as the Greeks had done but actually as a piece of garden sculpture. So there is a reuse or an appropriation of the iconography but a use for different purposes."""
Side Panel of a Sarcophagus,575.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Athens under the Roman Empire remained a center for sculpture in the Greek classical style. This Athenian relief from the mid third century A.D. was part of a stone sarcophagus. The carved scene alludes to a tragic theme of youth cut down in its prime. The standing nude male in the center is the hero Meleager resting his foot on a rock. With him are his companions on the hunt for the Caledonian boar an event that led indirectly to the death of Meleager. On the left sits Heracles with his club. A seated female figure on the right whose head has been lost represents Atalanta, the only woman in the hunting party. Notice Meleager’s head with its mane of curls. This resembles several portraits of Alexander the Great. The sculptor may have based this image on a contemporary painting that equated the heroic life and untimely death of Meleager with Alexander’s conquests and death in 323 B.C. Both Meleager and Alexander were believed to have died by decree of the Fates. To hear the story of Meleager now, press the green play button."""
Portrait Head of Emperor Hadrian,576.mp3,"""Narrator:  This marble head is a portrait of the Roman emperor Hadrian who ruled from 117 to 138 A.D. More portraits of Hadrian than of any other emperor have been found in the lands once ruled by Rome. Curator Karen Manchester. 
Karen Manchester:  He was an extremely popular emperor.  And he was particularly fond of Greek culture. He happened to have great admiration for the Greeks and, in particular, their philosophy. And as a consequence, he grew a beard which one can see represented faintly on the cheeks of this particular portrait. And this was something that Roman emperors before him had not done. But he adapted the wearing of a beard from Greek philosophers. This particular sculpture is also especially lovely because of the representation of the hair. One can see this great mass of curls over his forehead and deeply drilled. There’s a lot of interplay of light and shadow. 
Narrator:  The sculptor used a drill, again, on the eyes to create more realistic pupils."""
Seated Bodhisattva,577.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Traces of gold leaf cling to this lacquer sculpture which represents a Buddhist deity known in Japanese as bosatsu or bodhisattva in Sanskrit. Bosatsu are compassionate beings who chose to forgo full enlightenment while they assist others on the early plain. Here the deity sits in meditation raising his hands in a symbolic gesture. Only a few eighth century Japanese sculptures like this one reside outside of Japan. This rare bosatsu figure dates to around 775 A.D. and is the only Buddhist sculpture outside Japan that can be attributed to the workshops at the Temple of Tōdai-ji in the city of Nara. Traditional lacquer sculpture uses a hard resin derived from plant sap applied in multiple layers to a core. But this less labor intensive sculpture was assembled with pieces of partially hallowed wood, then covered with a layer of lacquer soaked fabric. Some details such a facial features were carved in the wood. Additional lacquer paste was applied to create other fine details."""
Jizo Bosatsu,578.mp3,"""Narrator:  In twelfth century Japan a cult developed around Jizo, the Buddhist figure seen here. This wood sculpture with applied colors and gold presents Jizo with a shaved head wearing the garb of a monk. His delicately carved and painted face expresses compassion as well as dignity. Jizo’s raised left hand holds a wish granting jewel. His right hand holds a staff with small rings. Monks carried the shakujō or monk’s staff to signal their approach while absorbing the rule of silence as they begged for alms. The sound also warned insects and other tiny creature in the path before a monk could step on them fulfilling the Buddhist precept of compassion for all living things. Jizo personifies one of the compassionate spirits known as a bosatsu or bodhisattva. He saved souls from the sufferings of hell. He also provided for children and unprotected women making him one of the most beloved and approachable deities in Japanese Buddhism."""
Sogyo Hachiman,579.mp3,"""Narrator:  The exposed wood grain on this tenth century figure reveals that it was carved from the heart of a tree. Like other traditional wood sculptures this originally was painted, the surface still carries traces of white pigment. The figure has a shaved head and sits cross-legged with its right foot resting on his left calf like a Buddha. You might assume that you’re looking at a Buddhist sculpture but this actually represents a deity of Shinto, the native religion of Japan. Until Buddhism arrived in Japan in the mid sixth century, Shinto deities were never depicted in human form. Religious imagery focused on revered places and natural forms. This deity, Hachiman, was a spirit of place that protected Mount Kawara. Copper ore from this mountain was used in creating a bronze Buddha at the Temple of Tōdai-ji in the city of Nara. Though the Japanese state had embraced Buddhism imperial officials nevertheless sought the good graces of Hachiman to ensure the safety of their copper supplies. Likewise, the Shinto priests of Hachiman accommodated Buddhism to some degree with figures like this one known as Sogyo Hachiman or Hachiman as a monk."""

These Buddhist figures were created to appeal directly to the viewer on a human level. Originally, they featured brightly colored paint. In Japanese religious art of every era the archetypal figure of a boy deity represents peace, renewal and fertility. In medieval Japan esoteric Buddhism assimilated a number of native boy deities known as Dōji. The fifteenth century figure on the right depicts Seitaka Dōji. He’s one of several boys who attend Fudo Myo-o an angry deity who represents absolute power over evil. On the left, the late twelfth century figure with his hands clasped is Zenzai Dōji. This boy pilgrim strides forward, his robes fluttering as he walks. According to a text named the Avatamsaka Sutra Zenzai visited 53 teachers in his search for the truth.

Bird Shaped Ewer with Crowned Rider Holding a Bowl,581.mp3,"""Narrator:  This twelfth century water vessel or ewer resembles a duck but the wings look too small for the body. And the head has a cockscomb. The tail feathers sweep up into an intricate handle. A human figure stands on the bird’s back holding a bowl. The elaborate garments in this figure were incised in the clay before firing along with the details of the bird’s body. The rich green blue glaze demonstrates the glowing color and subtle shifts in tone characteristic of Korean celadon ware. Ceramic artists in Korea developed this glaze in imitation of Chinese celadon ware. Korean artists’ mastery of glaze ceramic techniques in the Silla period laid the foundation for the innovative styles of the later Goryeo period examples of which you can also see in this gallery. Korean celadon glaze contains iron which takes on varying shades of green and blue when fired in an oxygen reduced kiln. Look closely for areas that brown slightly during firing where the glaze was applied thinly. The glaze naturally pooled in carved and concave areas giving them deep blue green color. Around the time this ewer was made, a Chinese envoy to Korea reported that the Chinese admired Korean celadon ware as surpassing their own saying it possessed quote, “The radiance of jade and the crystal clarity of water.”"""
Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja),582.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This bronze sculpture from around 1000 C.E. portrays Shiva Nataraja the Hindu god Shiva as lord of the dance. Madhuvanti Ghose is the Alsdorf curator of Indian and Islamic art at the Art Institute. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  The movement that is captured in this one moment where you have Shiva dancing within a circle of flames captures the moment when Shiva dances the Tāndava nrtya or this dance of destruction in a forest which he sets alight with the energy from his dance. You can see Shiva caught in this moment with his hair flaying all around him. And the matted hair locks capture the goddess Gangā or the river Ganges on Shiva’s right side. 
Narrator:  The small figure of the goddess sits with folded hands her head just touching the outer circle. In Vishnu’s raised left hand he holds a flame. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  While with the other raised arm on his right side he beats the drum as he’s performing this dance of destruction. His lower right hand is raised in the Abhaya mudra or the “do not fear” gesture. And he stamps on the demon of darkness, on Apasmara as he dances. This is perhaps one of the most iconic images from the Chola period. The holes that you see in the lotus pedestal at the bottom is where the rods would have gone through to hold this sculpture during a procession. It would have been carried high by the temple priests during processions so that the worshipers in the temple could see this amazing image."""
"Karttikeya, God of War, Seated on a Peacock",583.mp3,"""Narrator:  This remarkable granite sculpture depicts Shanmukha, a form of the Hindu god Kartikeya. Madhuvanti Ghose. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  We know Kartikeya by various names. He is sometimes called Kumara because of the fact that he was a young prince. He was the son of the goddess Parvati or Durga and the great god Shiva. And his brother was the elephant-headed Ganesh. Kartikeya had a complicated childhood where he was brought up by six mothers, the Krttikā’s or the Pleiades and that is why in order to drink the milk from these six mothers he has six heads which you can see by walking around the sculpture. The sculpture is in the round and it’s worth taking a walk around it to view it from all sides. 
Narrator:  The god also has six pairs of arms. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  And his various arms which hold these weapons indicate that he was a great warrior. In fact, he was the commander in chief of the armies of the gods. Shanmukha sits in the royal posture with one leg raised. He rides on his traditional vehicle a peacock. The bird holds a snake in its mouth symbolizing victory over evil. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  His right hand is raised in the “do not fear” or Abhaya mudra while his left is lowered in the Varada mudra or the hand gesture that denotes “giving” to his worshipers. It’s a gesture that indicates that he is granting people’s requests."""
Buddha Sheltered by the Serpent King Muchalinda,584.mp3,"""Narrator:  An incident in the life of the historical Buddha inspired this thirteenth century sandstone sculpture. A serpent king or Mucalinda once spread his multiple hoods over Buddha as a canopy to protect him from a storm. Here Buddha sits in the lotus posture of meditation on a seat formed by three coils of the serpent’s body. The Mucalinda’s seven hoods form a nimbus around Buddha’s head.  Buddha wears a crown. This identifies the figure as the transcendental Buddha Akshobhya rather than the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. Many images like this one were produced in today’s Thailand and Cambodia during the time of the Khmer Empire. The subject of Buddha sheltered by a Mucalinda became especially popular after it was endorsed by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII. In this sculpture each horizontal coil or register under the Buddha is wider than the one below. This arrangement resembles the ultra like seats of the earliest Indian Buddha’s. These three coils may allude to three worlds of early Buddhist and Hindu cosmology, the worlds of desire, of form and of formlessness."""
"Four-Armed Sarasvati, Goddess of Learning, Seated in Lotus Position (Padmasana)",586.mp3,"""Narrator:  The elaborate carving of this thirteenth century Indian deity exemplifies sculpture of the Hoysala dynasty. Madhuvanti Ghose spoke in the galleries about the subject of this sculpture. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  The goddess Saraswati was popular and venerated by the Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, all of the old religions of India. In fact, Saraswati was a river which now has gone into the deserts of northwest India as a river under the earth, under the soil, rather than a river that is visible. The Vedas are full of references to this ancient river Saraswati. Possibly because of this reason, she is soon personified as a goddess. And she symbolizes learning and all of the arts. The prabhamandala or the back of the sculpture is exquisitely carved. You see this beautiful this vegetal motif which actually represents the water coming out of the mouth of two crocodiles or makara’s which are on either side. 
Narrator:  One crocodile is located by Saraswati’s raised left hand which holds a noose. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  And then out of the mouth of these crocodiles come out this cruel like feature which is, in fact, representing the waters and the vegetation in the waters. And it’s all then being consumed by this monster mask or Kirtimukha which you see just above the crown of the goddess Saraswati.

Buddha Shakyamuni Seated in Meditation (Dhyanamudra),589.mp3,"""Narrator: Madhuvanti Ghose spoke in the galleries about this twelfth century granite Buddha from the south of India. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  This particular Buddha is shown seated in the lotus meditational posture with his hands resting in his lap. There are certain human beings in India who are marked from birth by tattoo [ph?] signs or lakshana’s. And the Buddha here has the urna which is a mark on his forehead between his brows which is like the spot of the third eye. He also is marked by the wheel of the law on the palm of his hands. And you see the energies that are being exuded from the Buddha emerging from the top of his head where you see these flames which, in fact, to a certain extent cover his ushnisha or cranial protuberance which is another symbol that marks him out to a special human being, a supernatural human being. If you care to look behind this gigantic sculpture you can see that there are some marks of an ancient inscription in the language of South India Tamil. But, in fact, it is so degraded now that we can’t read it. 
Narrator:  This Buddha was produced under the Chola empire which spread its cultural influence through conquests in India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. 
Narrator:  The Chola rulers, in fact, were Hindu. But they allowed Buddhism and Jainism to flourish in their vast dominions along with other faiths."""
Head of a Warrior,590.mp3,"""Narrator:  This earthen ware head represents that of a warrior. His simple masklike face conveys a sense of dignity and strength. Notice how the horizontal forms of his eyes are echoed by his mouth and eyebrows and balanced by the slim vertical line of its nose. Areas of reddish paint represent face decoration and the design details of his cap. The head was once part of a whole figurine designed to be placed by a tomb. It was made in the sixth century during the late Kofun period in Japan named after the sophisticated funerary customs of the time. Kofun literary means old burial mound. At this time, members of the ruling class were buried inside large earth mounds. Elaborate rituals probably accompanied the burial and the mounds were surrounded by many Haniwa or funerary earthenware objects like this warrior. Other forms included figures of men and women, houses and different kinds of animals. These symbolic objects acted as offerings. They’re also believed to have represented possessions that could help provide for the deceased in the afterlife."""
Partial Figure of a Pregnant Women,591.mp3,"""Narrator:  Made around 3000 years ago in Japan this figurine has a powerful presence despite its tiny size. It’s bent arm and long elegant body indicate that it was likely made to be held comfortably in one’s hand. And if you look closely the figurine seems to have a swollen belly. It likely represents a pregnant woman and may have been used in childbirth rituals intended to ensure a safe delivery for mother and child. Such figures also played a part in prayers for rebirth. Jōmon period figurines were made in a variety of sizes and shapes. Some were unadorned like this one, while others look like they are wearing elaborate costumes. Despites these differences these figurines have something in common. They are often found broken having been used or thrown away as part of a ritual."""
Bishamon,592.mp3,"""Narrator:  In a Japanese Buddhist sanctuary four divine guardian figures protect the cardinal directions north, south, east and west. This imposing eleventh century wooden figure represents Bishamonten, guardian of the north, traditionally a source of evil influence. In keeping with his role and position, Bishamonten’s expression is severe and his pose is active and confrontational. His costume is warlike. He wears a helmet and plated armor. This was originally decorated in gold and brightly colored pigments with images of dragons, flowers and patterning. If you look closely, you can still see traces of these decorations on the wooden surface. The figure was once armed with a spear in his right hand which referred to his duty to defend Buddhist law. In his left hand, there was once a small reliquary in the form of a miniature pagoda representing the teachings he protected. Bishamonten is worshipped individually in Japanese Buddhism unlike the other three guardians of the cardinal directions. He is revered as the god of wealth and is one of the seven Japanese gods of good fortune."""
Bell Krater (Mixing Bowl),595.mp3,"""Narrator:  This crater or mixing vessel dates from roughly 450 B.C. Prosperous Greek hosts used it when entertaining guests.  Terah Walkup of the Art Institute’s Ancient and Byzantine Art.
<music>
Terah Walkup:  It’s very likely that it was used in the symposium, the time for Greek men to get together, join in conversation with one another, recite poetry, discuss politics and enjoy food, drink and music. The Greeks never drank their wine at full strength but rather diluted it with water. This particular vessel was used to mix the wine and water. 
Narrator:  Vessels like this typically depict scenes of daily life or Greek mythology. Here a woman holds a pitcher along with a shield belonging to a seated warrior holding a staff. He’s taking part in the ceremony called the offering of libations, an offering of wine and water made by Greek warriors headed for war. The hope was that the gods would grant the warrior victory on the battlefield. The fact that this warrior is seated suggests that he’s of high status possibly Achilles, hero of the Trojan War. 
Terah Walkup:  This is a fine example of red figure vase painting. The red orange color is the natural terracotta clay showing through. The black is actually a slip which is painted on the clay and turns black when the vessel is fired. 
Narrator:  On the vessel’s opposite side the artist has added what seems to be a happy postscript a warrior’s safe return home. His spear is at rest pointing downwards.  He wears a wreath around his head. As he passes his helmet to one woman, a second reaches out, possibly to help him set down his heavy shield now that the fighting has ended."""
Kylix (Drinking Cup),596.mp3,"""Narrator:  Drinking cups such as this one called a kylix were used to serve wine during the Greek social gathering known as the symposium. Much like attending a symposium today participants exchanged news, discussed philosophy and debated issues and followed it all with a drink. Terah Walkup of the Art Institute’s department of ancient and Byzantine Art. 
Terah Walkup:  The symposium was a time for Greek men to get together to finely tune the art of conversation, to recite poetry, enjoy music, and dance performances as well as enjoy food and wine. 
Narrator:  To underscore the gathering’s masculine theme an artist decorated this cup with the image of an athlete wearing the leather hand straps of a boxer perhaps honoring a recent victor. As for those large painted eyes and expressive eyebrows they definitely helped lighten the mood. 
Terah Walkup:  The handles act as ears. And the stem of the vessel when upturned looks as if it’s an open mouth. When the drinker would have lifted this cup and brought the vessel to his face it would have appeared as if this drinker was wearing a mask.
Narrator:  Dionysus, god of wine, was also the god of Greek theater where all actors wore expressive masks. So drinking from a cup resembling a mask had an entertaining appeal especially since it doubled as an ancient party trick which surely grew more amusing as the wine continued to flow."""
Foot of a Cista (Storage Box),597.mp3,"""Narrator:  The Etruscans lived along the western coast of Italy and traded heavily with the Greeks. They imitated Greek pottery but also developed a distinctive artistic style of their own. This bronze foot was once part of a cosmetic storage box or cista that held the combs, makeup and perfumes of an aristocratic Etruscan woman. 
Terah Walkup:  The face of this figure is typical of Etruscan art. 
Narrator:  Terah Walkup of the Art Institute’s Department and Ancient Byzantine Art. 
Terah Walkup:  We see a figure who is skipping across the ocean’s waves perhaps the Etruscan sun god Usil bouncing, almost dancing. And there’s almost a slight smile to the face. 
Narrator:  The gentle curve of the wings and rows of curls are also typical of Etruscan art. 
Terah Walkup:  The eyes are wide and almond shaped. And the eyebrows are arched. The head looks gently down and the artist has described the torso with a very high degree of naturalism. This is in contrast to the very stylized pose typical of archaic Greek art. 
Narrator:  The Etruscans combined local copper and tin to make bronze. Thanks to artistry like this their wares found ready markets in the north and west of the Mediterranean region. 
Terah Walkup:  So while the Etruscans had a taste for Greek pottery and ceramics the rest of the Mediterranean world had a taste for Etruscan bronze."""
Tetradrachm (Coin) Portraying Queen Cleopatra VII,598.mp3,"""Narrator:  The political and romantic alliance of Egyptian queen Cleopatra and Roman Commander Marc Antony is legendary. During their ill-fated war against Rome they minted coins to pay their armies and settle debts.  This silver coin is remarkable not only because of the degree of detail but because it features the likenesses of both figures. And perhaps most interesting is the fact that Cleopatra appears on the front while Marc Antony receives second billing on the back. Katherine Raff Rice Foundation Curatorial Fellow in the Art Institute’s department of ancient and Byzantine Art. 
Katherine Raff:  Cleopatra is displayed on the obverse, the more important side. She was married to Marc Antony later in her life and they had children together. But she’s really staking a claim here saying that she is the more important of the two. 
Narrator:  The two profiles are nearly identical sharing the masculine features including the flat nose, strong chin and thick neck complete with large Adam’s apple. Across a political landscape ruled by men this served a dual purpose. Cleopatra was broadcasting her power as queen of Egypt while also emphasizing her partnership with Marc Antony. 
Katherine Raff:  You can see with her hair and necklace that she clearly is a woman but that seems to be less of a consideration than making a very bold point about her importance as a ruler."""
Statuette of Hercules,599.mp3,"""Narrator:  This bronze Roman statuette from the second century A.D. depicts Hercules known to the Greeks as Heracles. As the son of the god Jupiter by a mortal woman, Hercules was a half god who could achieve immorality. 
Katherine Raff:  He had tremendous strength. He was very brave. He was the epitome of all heroes. 
Narrator:  Katherine Raff, Rice Foundation Curatorial Fellow in the Art Institute’s department of ancient and Byzantine Art. 
Katherine Raff:  Hercules is known for completing twelve labors, a series of tasks. After he completed them he would become a god and join the other gods on Mount Olympus. We’re actually looking at Hercules just after he’s completed one of his labors retrieving the apples of a group of nymphs guarded by a serpent that never closed its eyes. 
Narrator:  The apples nestle in his right palm. On his head, vine leaves suggest the Olympian banquet in his future provided he completes all twelve labors. 
Katherine Raff:  He’s very muscular and monumental and looks back to a much earlier Greek bronze sculpture created by the famed sculptor Lysippos about 600 years earlier. 
Narrator:  Roman sculptors created their own versions of many famous Greek works made centuries earlier, some enormous and others small like this one. For the well to do Romans who bought them they had an elitist appeal. 
Katherine Raff:  To the Romans, you were very cultured if you knew about the Greek world and Greek literature and philosophy and mythology. To be able to own the sculptures or other art works that include images of gods and goddesses or that reference mythological figures showed that you were culturally sophisticated."""
Snake Headdress (a-Mantsho-ña-Tshol or Inap),600.mp3,"""Narrator:  This incredibly tall elegant sculpture represents a serpent. It’s sinuous wooden body painted with triangle and diamond patterns narrows before widening into a broad head with two circles for eyes. The sculpture was made in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century in Guinea West Africa. Its purpose is truly astounding. As you can see here the serpent was used as a headdress. It was tied to a conical framework of palm branches on the wearer’s head. The great serpent seemed to rise mysteriously from a costume of cloth and palm fibers that covered the wearer’s head and body. In the cultural traditions of the Baga and related peoples of coastal Guinea the snake spirit bestows the important gifts of rain, fertility and wealth. The serpent headdress was worn during initiation rights for young men or ritual competitions between different clans. Its wearer had to possess great strength. While balancing the wooden serpent on his head he performed a series of swift movements dipping and rotating his body so that the towering sculpture would seem to move in a convincingly snake like way. Large masks and headdresses such as those displayed on this platform were part of the ritual practices of coastal Guinea. Today, many of these masquerades continue to be performed as expressions of national identity and pride."""
Triptych Icon with Central Image of the Virgin and Child,601.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the central panel of this magnificent triptych or three-part painting the Virgin Mary holds up the infant Christ. The flanking wings include later episodes in Christ’s life. To the right, we see the crucifixion. At the top of the left panel Chris rises up to heaven while Adam and Eve cling to his robe. Beneath them St. George on a white horse battles a dragon. The triptych was made in the late seventeenth century in central Ethiopia where orthodox Christianity was established in the fourth century. Veneration of the Virgin Mary is a strong feature of Ethiopian Christian practice to this day. In the seventeenth century large triptychs like this were probably used as church icons. Smaller versions were commissioned by individuals for personal prayer and protection. In its three-part form, subject matter and pose of the virgin and child the triptych follows Western artistic conventions. These were brought to Ethiopia by Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. But it also contains many elements unique to the culture in which it was made. These include the flat bed on which the virgin sits. It is covered in a checkered pattern that is also found in Ethiopian church decoration. Christ’s necklace is made from Cowry shells. To this day, Ethiopians place such necklaces around children’s necks to ward off evil. The depiction of the figures is also distinctive. They are strongly outlined with bold flattened areas of shading and decorative linear patterning especially in the figure’s robes."""
Portrait Bust of a Woman,604.mp3,"""Narrator:  Katherine Raff, Rice Foundation Curatorial Fellow in the Art Institute’s department of ancient and Byzantine Art. 
Katherine Raff:  In the Roman world sculpture was found in public places. It was found in private places. It populated the Roman world in a way that there’s really no modern equivalent. 
Narrator:  A master sculptor carved this marble portrait of a woman at some point between 138 and 161 A.D. a time of peace and prosperity. 
Katherine Raff:  We don’t know who she is. But she likely came from a family of great status. Her tunic is actually so thinly carved that light shines through the marble so whoever carved this was an incredibly skilled sculptor. And the family who commissioned this must have been quite wealthy 
Narrator:  Her unique hairstyle of wavy locks and a braid coiled into a bun on the crown of the head was popularized by the Empress Faustina the Elder and her daughter Faustina the Younger. 
Katherine Raff:  And we know that they wore this hairstyle from portraits of these two imperial ladies as well as on coins. Often imperial women would be depicted on coins and that’s often how we can actually date these hairstyles. 
Narrator:  Her headband includes rectangular shapes but suggest semiprecious stones. 
Katherine Raff:  And this particular type of headband seems to have been worn by priestesses of the state sponsored Roman religion who would have been associated with carrying out the devotional rites associated with venerating the imperial family both in life and in death. 
Narrator:  Roman sculpture was typically painted often with bright colors. In this case, the sculpture might have been painted to match the subject’s hair, eye and skin tones. Sometimes, however, the skin was left alone letting the natural beauty of the marble shine through."""
Portrait Head of a Young Woman,606.mp3,"""Narrator:  This portrait head is of a young byzantine woman who lived during the fourth century A.D. 
Christina Nielsen:  From the fine marble and the fact that this was carved by a very accomplished sculptor this woman was of a very exalted status, quite likely part of the imperial circle. 
Narrator:  Christina Nielsen, assistant curator of late Roman, early Christian, and Byzantine art here at the Art Institute. 
Christina Nielsen:  She has features that are very finely rendered, high cheekbones, a very delicate brow, a bow shaped mouth. 
Narrator:  Three braids wrap around her head like a turban in what was actually a very retro style. 
Christina Nielsen:  Her hair style is consciously evoking earlier Roman empresses of the second century who were memorialized as ideal imperial wives, mothers, and daughters. 
Narrator:  This implied perfection was essential. While Roman emperors were sometimes elected based on their political or military merit Constantine the Great set up a precedent for dynastic succession that was followed throughout the history of the Byzantine empire. 
Christina Nielsen:  Images of empresses were very important markers of genealogy and bloodlines. And so they were depicted as beautiful and morally upright. 
Narrator:  Portraits of empresses were propagandistic tools that were even displayed in the Senate House in Constantinople. While we can’t say for certain who this woman was the classicizing style of imperial women’s clothing and hair styles would have been quickly adopted by others in the upper strata of Byzantine society."""
Goddess Durga Slaying the Buffalo Demon (Mahishasuramardini),610.mp3,"""Narrator:  This sandstone statue of the goddess Durga offers a glimpse into an ancient understanding of femininity. Madhuvanti Ghose, Alsdorf Associate Curator of Indian, Southeast Asian, Himalayan and Islamic Art. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  The feminine principle in Hinduism is portrayed in different aspects. Sometimes which is more feminine, and more pacific. And in other situations you see here in her more fierce aspect. And when you see the goddess Durga you are seeing one of the most fierce aspects of all of the feminine. 
Narrator:  According to scriptures the Hindu gods battled with a powerful demon in the form of a buffalo. To vanquish this demon the gods combined their powers in a single form the goddess Durga who conquered the buffalo demon and restored to the world.
Madhuvanti Ghose:  In this sculpture which comes from Cambodia around the late tenth century, probably from the Koh Kare [ph?] region. You are seeing the goddesses with multiple arms trying to pierce the buffalo demon who can be seen underneath her feet. You can see the head of the buffalo and her lion which is what she would ride.
Narrator:  In each of her raised hands, Durga brandishes an object representing her fearsome powers. Though the statue has been damaged you can see the Durga carries a dagger, a disc or shakra, a lotus flower held by the stem, a broken trident used to slay the demon and the conch shell."""
Cow Suckling a Calf,611.mp3,"""Narrator:  This lovely pink sandstone carving of a cow suckling a calf was made in central India in the ninth or tenth century. It most likely adorned the outer walls of a Hindu temple and was visible to pilgrims as they circumambulated or walked around the temple in worship.
Madhuvanti Ghose:  There is a particular ritual in which is it always clockwise meaning that you keep your right shoulder to the sacred monument. In most cases one would circumambulate at least once. Some people circumambulate more than once, maybe three times. But circumambulation as a form of veneration is very common in all of the religions that developed in south Asia.
Narrator:  As they circled the temple, worshipers might have followed stories carved in relief on the structure’s walls. This idyllic scene of a cow tenderly mothering her young calf might represent a moment in one such story though the rest of that narrative is lost.
Madhuvanti Ghose:  The scene is kind of unusual for a temple because temples usually don’t have that many relief panels that show secular scenes. One can speculate what the broader scene around this cow and calf would have been. Sometimes one sees cows as part of the scene around Krishna, the cow herd. And sometimes you see the cow very much in its nurturing aspects but certainly there is something very beautiful and serene about this particular sculpture and that tends to stop people as they walk through the galleries."""
"Shiva as Lord Who Is Half Male, Half Female (Ardhanarishvara)",612.mp3,"""Narrator:  This stone statue carved in the thirteenth or fourteenth century comes from Tomal Nadu in southern Indian. It depicts one of the most beloved deities in the pantheon of Hindu gods, one that is perhaps best known as the destroyer of the universe.  Madhuvanti Ghose. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  What we see here is the great god Shiva but in his aspect of Ardhanarishvara which means the lord who is half male half female. You see, for example, his matted locks, you see the almost ascetic garb that he wears and he’s accompanied by this bull, Nandi. But what is curious about the sculpture is the fact that you see a breast protruding from the torso signifying the aspect of Shiva who is one with this consort Parvati. That is Parvti’s breast that you’re seeing. She holds a lotus flower in her raised hand.  While Shiva might have held a trident in his raised upper hand, you see that Shiva is wearing a short loin cloth, while Parvati is wearing a longer garment which comes just above her ankles.
Narrator:  By merging him harmoniously with Parvati who embodies fertility, this depiction expresses Shiva’s multifaceted nature including destroyer, ascetic and great lover. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  When they come together they create the ideal union. And it’s said that Parvati meditated for many, many, many years in order to win Shiva. And when you bless an Indian couple after they get married you always wish that they have a union as happy as that of Shiva and Parvati."""
Stupa Reliquary,614.mp3,"""Narrator:  This intricately carved stone object was created in the second century in Gandhara, a region now divided between northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Called a reliquary it once contained sacred relics associated with a Buddhist monk or other revered person. It is fashioned in the shape of a stupa an ancient Buddhist architectural structure inside which the reliquary itself would have been buried. Madhuvanti Ghose. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  The Buddha, according to one of Buddhism’s most sacred manuscripts tells us that after he is gone and cremated his remains were to be buried and stupa’s were to be created over this remains. 
Narrator:  By the third century B.C.E. thousands of stupas of monumental size dotted the south Asian landscape. They may have honored the Buddha, famous monks or revered patrons. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Most of these buildings don’t exist now. So we have to understand the form of the Buddha’s stupa from reliquaries such as this that have survived. 
Narrator:  You can see the remnants of umbrellas which would have adorned the top of the stupa. These indicate the Buddha’s royal origins. He was born a prince. The hemispherical mound in the center houses the relics. And the four lion capital pillars located at each of the corners symbolize the Buddha’s lion roar spreading his word in all directions. The brick faced dome itself was solid and could not be entered. So devotees paid their respects by circumambulating or ritually walking around the structure. The stupa’s railings and gateways were often adorned with relief panels showing important miracles in the life of the Buddha so followers could meditate on them as they walked. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  They developed over time in their ornamentation. The early stupas were very plain hemispherical domes perhaps with a railing or a little gateway. But then they became more and more elaborate. And over time, entire monastic complexes developed around a stupa. ""
"
Emblem of the God Shiva with One Face (Ekamukhalinga),615.mp3,"""Narrator:  This is a Shiva linga the phallic emblem of the god Shiva from about the fifth century A.D., a golden age which is regarded as one of the most beautiful periods of Indian art. The linga is traditionally regarded as a formless, abstract image of the god. Many linga’s depict Shiva with four faces one in each of the cardinal directions. But this sculpture shows Shiva with a single tranquil face. Madhuvanti Ghose. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  You’re seeing a very serene aspect of Shiva with his eyse lowered in meditation, his full lips and his matted hair locks which crowd over his head. 
Narrator:  The linga is a sacred object which is worshipped as a way of communing with the god. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Usually, a linga such as this, is scene in the sanctum of a Hindu which is called the womb house or the garbhagriha. It is right at the center underneath a very tall temple tower. And within that the sanctum is usually a very dark space like a cave. And the only thing in it would have been this Shiva linga. 
Narrator:  Priests entering the shadowing inner sanctum anoint the linga with sacred substances such a streaks of bright vermillion pigment and sandalwood oil. They poured milk and other liquids over the linga as offerings to Shiva a god known both as a great lover and the destroyer of worlds."""
Lion-Headed Incarnation of God Vishnu (Narasimha),616.mp3,"""Narrator:  This intricate bronze statue inlaid with silver shows the lion-headed incarnation of Vishnu. It was made in Orissa on the coast of Eastern Indian in the fifteenth century. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Vishnu in Hinduism is regarded as the preserver of the universe and he takes many different incarnations or avatars and his man-lion form is one of the most famous and renowned. In this form, he is trying to destroy a demon who had a boon from the gods that he could not be destroyed by a man or a beast. So Vishnu takes the form that is half man, half beast, that of the man-lion. And this form is called Narasimha. 
Narrator:  Narasimha’s flaring headdress resembles the mane of a lion. His bulging eyes and his toothy grin marked with traces of blood red pigment add to his ferocious terrifying appearance. The pigment would have been applied in the temple as the deity was venerated. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Narasimha is seated with this knees bound almost ascetic-like holding on to his Shakti or his female energy, the goddess of the earth and of fertility who is seen holding a lotus flower in her hand. While Narasimha himself is holding the emblems of Vishnu which include the discus and the conch shell. 
Narrator:  It’s hard to say exactly how this sculpture might have been used. While ritual bronzes were displayed in sacred temples, they were sometimes paraded through the streets on festival days as part of great celebratory processions."""
"Image of a Goddess, Possibly Uma",617.mp3,"""Narrator:  This beautiful slender bronze statue depicts a Hindu goddess possibly Uma. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Uma is an aspect of the goddess as the consort of the god Shiva and one of the most pacific aspects of the goddess. Here you’re seeing the goddess with four arms holding certain attributes including possibly a mirror in one of her hands and a lotus bud. The mirror and the lotus show her in her more female aspects. 
Narrator:  The bronze was made in a region that is now part of Vietnam. In the ninth and tenth centuries Indic religions were introduced there by merchant traders stopping along a shipping route between India and China. New religions were embraced and reinterpreted in the local style. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Vietnam, particularly southern Vietnam had a culture that was quite Indic in its influence. And many Indian gods both Hindu and Buddhists were popular in the Cham regions of Vietnam. And so it’s not surprising to find images of this goddess. But what you are seeing is a goddess that shows the local Dong Duong style of the Cham kingdom.  Notice the facial features of this female figurine, particularly the full lips, the broad, rather flat nostrils and the beautifully arched joined eyebrows. 
Narrator:  Uma’s long tightly wrapped sarong or skirt with its intricately carved floral front panel is also typical of the Dong Duong style. Originally, the figure was decorated with a gemstone in her forehead and detachable earrings, now lost. The striking jade colored patina on this bronze statue developed over many centuries."""
Simian Mother and Child,618.mp3,"""Narrator:  This charming expressive sandstone sculpture shows two lively monkeys, a mother and her young child.
Madhuvanti Ghose:  This sculpture is very simple image of a simian mother and child. But the affectionate bond between the mother and the child is particularly powerful. From the materials it is quite clear that this sculpture comes from Indonesia possibly from Eastern Java around the thirteenth century. 
Narrator:  It’s difficult to be certain in what context the sculpture would be seen but most likely it would have been placed in the vicinity of a temple. You’ll notice the sculpture was made to be viewed in the round, so it likely would have sat on some sort of pedestal rather than adorning a wall. We can’t know if this humble carving was made for a Hindu or a Buddhist temple because at that time in Indonesia both religions flourished. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  It is the very ordinariness of the sculpture that seems to attract people and makes this monkey holding its child one of the most popular images in our galleries."""
"God Vishnu Riding His Mount, Garuda",619.mp3,"""Madhuvanti Ghose:  In this painted wooden sculpture we see the Hindu god Vishnu riding on his vehicle, the bird Garuda. 
Narrator:  Made in Bali, Indonesia this sculpture presents a beautiful and detailed image of Garuda with a protruding beaklike mouth and outstretched wings. Vishnu one of the most important deities in the pantheon of Hindu gods is revered as the great protector of the universe. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Vishnu often takes different incarnations in order to save the universe. But in this instance, you’re seeing Vishnu fly across the heavens on the bird Garuda. He is seated in a yogic posture with his arms together in the center. And he is accompanied on either side by attendants who you can see venerating him. 
Narrator:  According to sacred texts as preserver of the entire cosmos Vishnu took flight to survey not only the heavens but also earthly realms in the underworld. You’ll notice Garuda’s fierce expression as he spreads his wings. This wooden polychrome sculpture was made in Indonesia during the nineteenth century. And the colorful pigments used are still vibrant. The statue was probably part of a sendi, the base of a pillar that supported beams and columns in a Balinese ceremonial pavilion. The winged deity Garuda remains a popular figure in Indonesian culture today even lending his name to the national airline."""
Standing Buddha,620.mp3,"""Narrator:  The delicate rendering of the robes on this standing Buddha is typical of the Sarnath School which flourished during the fifth century in India and is generally regarded as the classical period of Indian art. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  The Sarnath School was renowned for showing standing Buddhas and seated Buddhas with drapery that was almost diaphanous. And the style was to reveal the body of the Buddha without showing too many striations of the monastic robe. You just barely see the monastic robe around the neck, covering both shoulders and then around the arms and the feet of the Buddha. 
Narrator:  The impact of the Sarnath style first appears in early representations of the Buddha from Central Asia and China and, in particular, southeast Asia. The standing body comes from Thailand perhaps from a regional center of the Mantuaravati [ph?] culture of the seventh through ninth centuries. The bulky slightly squat proportions of the body are local interpretations of the classical Indian style as reimagined in the Mantuaravati style. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Unfortunately, the hands of this Buddha are broken, but we can estimate the mudras or gesture in which the hands would have been placed. 
Narrator:  Most Mantuaravati Buddha’s stand in a frontal fixed stance and hold both their hands with the palm raised and the forefinger and thumb joined in the gesture of teaching or the tarka mudra. Both the classical stance you see here and the portrayal of the seated Buddha in meditation in a comforting calming presence were popular throughout southeast Asia."""
First Jaina Tirthankara Rishabhanatha Standing in Meditation (Kayotsarga),621.mp3,"""Narrator:  You’re standing in front of an image of a Tirthankara a being worshipped by followers of the Jain religion, a faith that developed locally in South Asia along with Buddhism and Hinduism. Jainism has similarities to Buddhism but is a distinct faith with strong ideas about nonviolence and equality among all lifeforms. This Tirthankara is depicted in standing meditation, a rigid stance called Kayotsarga. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  Jains venerate a group of beings that are called Tirthankara, those who forge the rivers of life. And usually you would see a series of these Jain, these Tirthankara standing in meditation at Jain sides like monasteries and temples. The only way you can distinguish one Tirthankara from another would be by very small details. In this case the Rishabhantha has some hair that falls down his shoulders and from those skulls we know that this is the first Jain Tirthankara, Adinatha or Rishabhantha. 
Narrator:  Look closely and you’ll see the Tirthankara is standing on a lotus blossom. And another lotus blooms behind his head. The slender precise portions of the body and the fine details of the carving including the delicately rendered bow at the waist give this work a feeling of quiet harmony. The Kayotsarga pose is a yogic meditative pose. Kayotsarga means to give up one’s physical comfort and motion in order to concentrate the mind in pure meditation. It is also a pose where one achieves extreme nonviolence, ahimsa, and avoids stepping on any living creature. A Tirthankara can achieve enlightenment, moksha, in this pose. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  From the style, we can date this sculpture to about the tenth, eleventh century. And it is of Bafgallut [ph?] sandstone so it tends to make us believe that it comes from possibly one of the great temple sites of central India where we have many wonderful Jain monuments."""
Crowned and Bejewelled Buddha Seated on an Elephant Throne,622.mp3,"""Madhuvanti Ghose:  We’re looking at this wooden lacquered seated Buddha. This is quite a monumental sized Buddha. And it’s particularly striking because of the lacquer and the gilding that you can still see on it. It is worth noticing that the Buddha is seated on an elephant throne. You can see these little elephants popping out from underneath the base of the seat of the Buddha.  And the seat itself is lacquered in bright red. The sculpture is also inset with semiprecious gems. 
Narrator:  The Buddha is seated in the lotus position with his right hand in Bhumisparsha or the “earth touching gesture”, calling the earth to witness his enlightenment. 
Narrator:  And what is wonderful about this wooden Buddha is the fact that you’re seeing a crowned Buddha from Burma dated to around the nineteenth century. The concept of crowned Buddhas originated in eastern India in the Middle Ages. And became particularly popular in southeast Asia. 
Narrator:  The crowned Buddha is a reference to a myth about a cruel arrogant king who lived in the time of the Buddha. By transforming himself into a lavishly attired king the Buddha was able to persuade the cruel king to follow his teachings. In southeast Asia royalty enjoyed semi-divine status so representations of the crown Buddha served as a reminder that even kings must seek enlightenment."""
Inscribed Ritual Crown with Five Transcendental Buddhas,623.mp3,"""Narrator:  Look closely at this intricate gilded ritual crown and you’ll see its decorated with five Buddhas all seated on lotus blossom thrones. Each Buddha is making a different hand gesture or mudra. The Vajra a diamond or half thunderbolt motif appears at the crown’s apex. The thunderbolt form of the Vajra symbolizes the sudden striking experience of enlightenment. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  We believe that during certain rituals particularly of the Vajrayana form of Buddhism, a particular sect within Buddhism monks would wear such crowns which are adorned with these meditating Dhyani Buddhas in order to identify himself with the cosmic principle and the primordial Adi-Buddha.
Narrator:  Just below the principle Buddha at the center of the crown you’ll see a face of glory or kirtimukha with gemstone eyes and gilt foliage spurting from its mouth. This crown was made in Nepal most likely by a highly skilled Newari craftsman. The Newari’s were renowned for their stunning work with metal and inlays of glittering semiprecious stones. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  What makes this crown even more interesting is the fact that it is inscribed and it is dated. It says that in 1090 in the reign of King Harsha Deva [ph?] this magnificent crown was commissioned by Vajrashila who lives in the Mahavat Buddhist monastery."""
Necklace Inscribed with the Name of King Pratapamalladeva,624.mp3,"""Narrator:  This exquisitely crafted inscribed necklace was commissioned by a king as a gift for a Hindu goddess. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  The necklace is decorated in many registers which include on the outer most ring eight roundels of the mother goddess called the Ashta Matrikas meaning eight mothers, each depicting the goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon. The inscription reads, “Victory to the mother goddess,” <in Hindi>. This is the necklace of the great king lord of kings, lord of the poets, the victorious Pratap Malla Deva. 
Narrator:  We know that King Pratap Malla Deva reigned in the Katmandu Valley of Nepal between 1641 and 1674. And that he probably offered this necklace to the goddess Taleju Bhawani, the patron goddess of his palace. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  It’s quite likely that the necklace would have adorned a sculpture or some kind of image of the goddess Taleju Bhawani. And the king might have presented a necklace such as this on a particular occasion. It could have been as a result of a victory. It could have been because it was a particular important day in the religious calendar of the temple. 
Narrator:  Worshipers whether kings or commoners sometimes offered jeweled ornaments to gods or goddesses in hope of fulfillment of a wish or as thanks for a prayer that was answered. We can’t know what Pratap Malla Deva asked of his goddess but this exquisite necklace suggest that his request was equally lavish. Look closely, and you’ll see traces of the ritual vermilion pigment that has been applied in veneration over the centuries."""
Boar Incarnation of God Vishnu,625.mp3,"""Narrator:  This basalt sculpture of Vishnu made in central India in the tenth century illustrates the Hindu god’s role as preserver and guardian. According to legend the earth, weighed down by evil, begins to sink into the cosmic oceans. 
Madhuvanti Ghose:  What you’re seeing is a scene where the earth goddess had been submerged under the cosmic oceans and the god Vishnu takes the form of the boar and jumps in through the cosmic oceans to rescue her. And when he is coming up she is clinging for dear life to his tusks. The earth goddess is regarded as the consort of Vishnu. Vishnu has two consorts. One is Bhu-Devi or the earth goddess and the other is Lakshmi, the goddess of fertility and wealth. 
Narrator:  The serpent or naga you see beneath the boar’s snout symbolizes the cosmic oceans as does the seated figure near the boar’s belly. A carved lotus blossom decorates the boar’s head and an umbrella probably once shaded the entire scene though only a stump on the boar’s back remains. Sculptures like this boar incarnation of Vishnu being both in the round and fully theriomorphic or in animal form would usually have their own small side temple facing the Vishnu temple. The body of the boar is sculpted with rows of gods, demi-gods and animals symbolizing the entire cosmos. It is the only one of its kind in the United States and something well worth seeing."""
Tanktotem I,650.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the early 1930s American sculptor David Smith began to create small works of art found from scrap metal. “Tanktotem I” made in 1952 from welded steel is his first large scale sculpture. It consists of commercial boiler tanks and other machine parts Smith had ordered from mail order catalogs. Kate Nesin, the Art Institute’s associate curator of contemporary art explains that “Tanktotem I” is the first in a series of ten such works. The sculptures are remarkable for their starkly anthropomorphic qualities. 
Kate Nesin:  They have a relationship to the human body because the look figural. They’re upright. In fact, quite spindly in their vertical form. They have legs or feet where they meet their base. The boiler heads do look like heads that are sort of jaunty, ducking down towards us or over us. The height of the piece is a little bit over human size but not overwhelming so.  We can have a kind of encounter with it almost like a face to face exchange as we approach and move around this sculpture. 
Narrator:  Smith includes both abstract and figurative elements in this work recalling earlier movement in twentieth century art. 
Kate Nesin:  Smith tended to talk about as a formative moment for him first seeing Picasso’s welded steel sculptures in photographic reproduction in a magazine in 1930. He resisted being connected to, for example, surrealist practice. Yet, he used a lot of the language of surrealism. He would talk often about dream images and subconscious images. 
Narrator:  Smith’s title “Tanktotem” is a made up word. It suggests an object that is at once coveted and taboo successfully blending modern industrial and ancient shamanistic world views."""
CIty Landscape,651.mp3,"""Kate Nesin:  This is one of my favorite paintings we have. Joan Mitchell’s “City Landscape” from 1955. 
Narrator:  Curator Kate Nesin. 
Kate Nesin:  It’s a work that has been described primarily according to this tangle of pigments that stretched horizontally across the center of the canvas. It’s a dripping painting, a slashing painting. The strokes are visible as if laid down really vigorously in haste. 
Narrator:  But, in fact, Mitchell worked quite methodically. 
Kate Nesin:  She would say that she would paint a little and then sit and look at the painting, sometimes for hours. And she described eventually the painting told her what to do. So she really built the surface up mark by mark stroke by stroke over time despite the tangle and speed and density implied by the title of “City Landscape.”
Narrator:  Though keenly aware of its abstract elements curator Nesin initially read the image as a distant skyline with a cloudy sky above and gray reflective water below. 
Kate Nesin:  But there are all sorts of different viewpoints we could step into. There is the sense in which this could be an aerial view, a kind of dense island city surrounded by water. This could be a nighttime or a twilit evening view of a city street on a rainy day. So that tangle of pigments are lights of various kinds that are lost in this dripping mass of sky and gray concrete building. This is a painting that collapses a number of possible representational views into a single densely worked abstract surface."""
Chikatsusei Maunkinshi (Golden Wings Brushing the Clouds Incarnated from Earthly Wide Star),652.mp3,"""Narrator:  Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga created this canvas in 1960. He lifted the title “Chikatsusei Maunkinshi” or “Golden Wings Brushing the Clouds Incarnated from Earthly Wide Star” from a famous fourteenth century Chinese novel. Like the American abstract expressionist painter, Jackson Pollock Shiraga preferred to paint on the floor. 
Kate Nesin:  There are not strokes of paint as we might expect from a fast moving brush but instead these giant swaths and curves and loops of paint. They’re not made even with Shiraga’s hand. These are, in fact, marks that Shiraga made with his feet and that accounts for a great deal of the really aggressive even violent quality of this way of laying paint on to canvas. 
Narrator:  Shiraga gave his painting an almost three dimensional quality. 
Kate Nesin:  There’s a topography to the painting. There are these small hillocks and mountains of paint that have built up because of the way it’s been pushed around on the surface. 
Narrator:  The artist claimed that he came to paint with his body when he accidentally slipped on wet paint and fell on to this canvas. 
Kate Nesin:  It’s a funny story and the chance nature of it was appealing for him. It’s not exactly how it happened. He really made a conscious decision to move from hand to foot. He realized that the best way to accomplish the foot paintings on a larger and larger scale was to string himself from a harness from the ceiling and actually swing across the canvases slipping and sliding as he was swinging. 
Narrator:  Shiraga’s paintings began as vivid public performances. But by 1960 when he made this painting, he worked exclusively in his studio. To learn more about his artistic background, press play."""
Short Circuit,653.mp3,"""Narrator:  To describe his innovative multimedia creations Robert Rauschenberg coined the term “Combine” a hybrid between painting and sculpture. This early combine from 1955 called “Short Circuit” contains two cabinets and an array of different objects. 
Kate Nesin:  This work can be shown with the cabinet doors closed but we tend to show it with the doors open because there are other works hung inside these cabinets. This the only combine that Rauschenberg kept for himself for his entire life but had a real personal meaning for him. 
Narrator:  In 1955 Rauschenberg submitted this work to an exhibition in New York City. Before the exhibition he invited friends to contribute small paintings to add to the combine. Susan Weil created the brushy scene on the upper right and Jasper Johns contributed a painting of the American flag on the left which was later stolen and replaced by a copy by conceptual artist Elaine Sturtevant. The burlap and lace across the bottom suggests the coverings of a bed or perhaps the dressings of a window filled with photographs and personal ephemera. On the bottom left just above the lace fabric you’ll even find and autograph by Judy Garland. 
Kate Nesin:  What Rauschenberg was interested in was surprise, what happens when you put these two things side by side or when you treat the historically sacred surface of painting with this kind of exuberance and roughness. He wanted his practice always to be generous and open to interpretations. You even see the word open scrawled in the upper right quadrant which is attached to an arrow that points to the cabinet door. So there’s something quite literal about open but there’s also simply an openness to this kind of work."""
Untitled,654.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the mid-1960s Donald Judd began making what would become his signature sculptures commonly referred to as “Stacks”. He created this stack in 1968 after he had firmly established the compositional rules of his series. 
Kate Nesin:  Each stack includes ten identical units, these sort of box like forms. The boxes are always the exact same size. And the distance between them is always equal to the height of each box unit itself. So there’s a real exactitude here, a real meticulousness of installation. 
Narrator:  To eliminate all traces of the artist’s hand Judd had them commercially fabricated. The boxes are made from stainless steel with amber Plexiglas tops and bottoms. Subtly shifting effects of light lend the work a mysterious jewel like appearance. 
Kate Nesin:  You can see shadows scattered almost 360 degrees around this kind of columnar or spine-like form across the wall filling in the space in between the boxes and expanding the stack outward against the wall. The shadows, if the light is strong, can be particularly orange. They can be much paler. They can almost seem to push towards a kind of yellow or pink, again, depending on the quality of light and depending on how you approach the work. To experience this work is to have a really physical encounter with it and to appreciate the lushness of the materials that he’s chosen, even the sleekness of industrial fabrication contributes to that sense of lushness."""
Khee II,657.mp3,"""Narrator:  This 1978 painting by Jack Whitten is called “Khee II” after the letter in the Greek alphabet. A native of Alabama, Whitten came to New York in 1960. As a young African-American painter he initially struggled to find his own voice. 
Kate Nesin:  In 1965 he wrote on his studio wall that he must photograph his thoughts. He was interested in the idea of recording an image where the camera couldn’t go. And his studio became a sort of laboratory for achieving this photographic effect. 
Narrator:  Working on the floor or a tabletop Whitten began by placing flat objects under a canvas and creating an impression of them. He then painted the canvas with Gesso a white primer or ground color. While the paint was still wet he placed thin sheets of colored rice paper on top, allowing them to dissolve and leave behind traces of pure pigment. Whitten finished by raking various tools across the surface combs, rubbers, wire or notch metal as if to develop the painting surface like a photograph. The results often surprised him. 
Kate Nesin:  It was really about the process and bringing the process to light.  As Whitten put it, once, “Whatever happens on the plain of my paintings has to take place instantly and has to catch and freeze something.” So he’s freezing these different moments of his process within a single abstract canvas."""
Untitled #12,659.mp3,"""Narrator:  A Canadian by birth, Agnes Martin was an abstract painter who settled first in New York City and then in New Mexico. Her minimalist paintings often feature a tight compositional grid made of pencil marks and super imposed with diaphanous washes of color. Martin created “Untitled Number 12” in 1977. 
Kate Nesin:  It’s not a canvas that is easy to see or perceive right away. From a distance it might look like a pale gray monochrome with no other kind of surface inflection. And as you can come closer you can begin to make out the grid.  The pencil marks do emerge. It’s an incredibly delicate surface. 
Narrator:  The grid produces a subtle shimmering or vibrating of the surface. The pale hues seem to float off the canvas. 
Kate Nesin:  The closer you look, you can see that here and there the graphite line shakes or trembles. It’s really hand drawn and where the pencil skips over the week of the campus becomes a part of the overall effect of the painting, the imperfection of this otherwise perfect grid."""
"Vase (Hu) with Horizontal Bands, Loop Handles, and Lionlike Medallions",660.mp3,"""Narrator:  This face was created during the short lived Sui Dynasty which we reigned at the turn of the sixth century A.D. Elinor Pearlstein, the Art Institute’s associate curator of Chinese art notes he vessel is unusual in several respects. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  It’s a very graceful piece with an ovoid body that gently contracts to this very slender flaring neck and cupped mouth. What is most notable about it though is the glaze, this olive green that we call celadon. Celadon is a western term and is thought to be derived from the name of character in the seventeenth century French comedy who wore a grayish-green robe. 
Narrator:  Celadon is among the earliest type of Chinese stoneware. It’s range of soft olive and blueish greens was created when the iron rich glaze as fired in a kiln with little oxygen. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  You can also see that fine cracks have formed across the glaze. This is an accident. It’s caused when the body shrinks at a different rate than the glaze. Later on that crackle becomes quite deliberate for decorative effect. 
Narrator:  The pooling and darkening of the glaze around the raised ridges and the thick drips near the bottom were also quite unintentional. Note the lion-like masks encircling the shoulder.

Bowl in Saggar,662.mp3,"""Narrator:  What you’re seeing here is an instructive accident. It’s a sturdy thick walled stone ware ball fused with its saggar a firing container made form rougher clay. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  Pieces were fired in individual saggars and then stacked in the firing chamber in order to maximize the space and insulate the vessels from flame and from ash. The people who made this type of ware favored this coarse, thick walled cylindrical saggar which encouraged the uniform flow of the gases around each vessel. In this case, the saggar simply collapsed and the pieces stuck inside. When you turn this piece upside down you’ll see the base of the bowel broke the bottom part of the saggar. 
Narrator:  The cloudy lavender blue color of the glaze is an optical allusion which the potter carefully brought about. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  What happens is that the potter is prolonging the cooling of the kiln at the end of the firing cycle. And inducing glaze to sort of bubble with these minute glassy crystals that reflect and scatter blue light. 
Narrator:  The bright purple splash on the other hand is a true color created by a sprinkling of copper oxide onto the glaze. Bowls like this are known as Jian ware after the kiln site in northern China where they were first discovered."""
Cup and Cupstand,663.mp3,"""Narrator:  Lustrous dark glazes, like the one on this cup and cup stand of the eleventh century, mirror the glossy effect of lacquerware made in China at this time. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  They’re often referred to as black glazed ware but they’re not pure black. This very dark color is created by a high proportion of iron in the glaze fired in a kiln that’s rich in oxygen. 
Narrator:  The small bowl gracefully sits on top of a stand designed as a smaller cup attached to a high footed saucer. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  What’s unusual about this piece is that the receptacle and the cup itself are so perfectly matched in glaze tonality indicating that the comprise one of the very few original sets that are preserved today. The cup and the cup stand would have been fired separately but probably in the same area of the same kiln. 
Narrator:  By this time, tea had become the subject of true connoisseurship.  Ways of preparing, presenting and serving the beverage were considered art forms by the well to do but only when transmitted to Japan did this practice become a true ritual what we recognize today as a tea ceremony. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  I think people in the West associate tea with rather dark color. But at this time tea would have been made from leaves that were white that were then powdered and whipped so that the tea created the white foam around the edge. When the tea was drunk the aim was to keep that white foam around the edge of the cup. It was a bit of game."""
Pair of Cups,664.mp3,"""Narrator:  This pale green writing box or pen case comes to us from the Qing dynasty China’s last imperial era. Qing monochrome porcelain such as this are among the most elegant ceramics ever produced. Looking carefully, you’ll see delicately molded designs a dragon amid clouds on the cover, and twisted rope in what’s called a Key Fret pattern around the sides of the container. But curator Elinor Pearlstein notes that the function of pieces of this is still a bit of a puzzle. 
Elinor Pearlstein:  No one really seems to have thought about their usage because their early examples in blue and white that seem to be modeled directly after Middle Eastern metal examples. It’s thought that those were not used for Chinese writing at all but made for Muslims in China because the compartments are so small they would not have been suitable for Chinese style ink and brush. 
Narrator:  The rectangular opening probably held water. And the three round containers were probably designed to contain colored inks.

Tall Case Clock,681.mp3,"""Narrator:  Curator Judy Barter.
Judy Barter:  This is such an interesting object because the clock was made early around 1820 and yet the decoration is from the 1880s. So this is someone updating and old piece of furniture to make it appear contemporary. At the time, one of the things that was so popular in the 1880s was Japanism. 
Narrator:  This meant Japanese influenced art and imagery. A fascination with Japanese art had swept America and Europe since Japan was reopened to western trade in the 1850s following over 200 years of virtual isolation. 
Judy Barter:  And if you look at the sides of the clock, particularly you will see Japanist [ph?] designs, in other words, asymmetrical vignettes, flattened quality of design, elaborate scenes and gold painted cartouches. These are all taken right out of books of Japanist design. On the front, however, is the history of a section of Maine, which at the time of the founding of the United States was still a part of the state of Massachusetts. So there’s a Revolutionary War battle at Lexington, Massachusetts, for example, that’s depicted here. 
Narrator:  This is in the roundel in the center of the clock’s door. The largest scene painted on the base of the clock shows a conflict between Native Americans and settlers."""
Fan-Backed Windsor Chair,682.mp3,"""Narrator:  This fan-backed Windsor chair was made in Philadelphia around 1770. Its design is a simple one and yet discretely nods to the rococo style, then so fashionable, in the scrolling ends of its top rail and the serpentine curves of its arms. Windsor chairs were named after the English town with its royal castle near which they were originally produced. The design was probably introduced to America in the 1730s by an Englishman who came over to act as lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. Windsor chairs, which were also made with arms, became extremely popular in Philadelphia and the design was soon adopted by chair makers across the country. Curator Judy Barter. 
Judy Barter:  This was rather common seating furniture in the Colonial Times and you can see why that might be the case, unlike a highly carved Chippendale or Queen Anne chair, these pieces could almost be mass produced. So this was fairly cheap furniture to make and it was in lots of public spaces, for example, in Independence Hall in Philadelphia. They’re popular today, as well, just a Shaker furniture is popular today because those are forms that are viewed as simple and rather modern."""
"Basin Depicting a Cistern, Tower and Domed Building",683.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This seventeenth century basin was made in Mexico. Its decoration reveals a fascinating mix of influences. In the center is a cluster of fanciful buildings, these and the floral designs on the basin’s outer rim are adapted from imagery on Chinese ceramics. Chinese influenced peonies decorate the basin’s deep interior wall. But the surrounding dotted patterns and curved forms are derived from Islamic art. Meanwhile the basin’s overall shape recalls Turkish and Egyptian pottery. How did this Mexican-made basin come to draw inspiration from opposite ends of the world? The answer lies in contemporary Mexican history. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico potters came over from Spain to work in the thriving economy of the new world. They brought with them Spanish ceramics whose Islamic inspired decoration was rooted in the Moorish occupation of southern Spain. the Mexican pottery making town of Pueblo was soon established. It lay on the Spanish trade route through the country along which were carried Chinese ceramics on their way to Europe via the Philippines. So the potters of Pueblo were able to add Chinese imagery to their international array of design influences."""
Cornelius Allerton,684.mp3,"""Narrator:  These wonderful family portraits were made around 1822 by Ammi Phillips. 
Judy Barter:  Portrait artists did travel around a great deal in order to find clients. They were often times trained as sign painters which accounts for the flatness of these portraits and the linearity of them and the importance of outline. Phillips was one of the most sophisticated of the early folk portraitists in America. This is Cornelius Allerton and Lois Allerton. They’re mother and son. 
Narrator:  Cornelius holds a weighty medical dictionary indicating his profession and social prominence. 
Judy Barter:  The horse was painted on top of the present pain which means it was added later, we don’t know when. And it may refer to the birth of a child to have this little toy here so that it shows him as a father.

Judy Barter:  And that’s very interesting to me because in New York state where the Allerton’s were living there was a lot of religious revivalism that happened around 1815 to 1820.

Country Preacher,685.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This wooden sculpture of a nineteenth century African-American preacher may have been made before or after the Civil War. It is a portrayal of great dignity and seriousness. Well-dressed in the long coat and soft necktie of the times, the preacher seems lost in meditation, his brow wrinkled with thought. The Bible lies in his lap, open at a page that he is perhaps using as inspiration for a sermon. There is much that remains on unknown about this unusual depiction including the identity and objectives of the artist who carved it. Curator Judy Barter.
Judy Barter:  We don’t know the use that this sculpture was put to. But the African-American preacher was a very important figure within the community. It held the black community together. And the African-American religious experience was extremely important as a passive resistance to slavery.

Jar,686.mp3,"""Narrator:  Vermont, where this jar was made around 1830, was known for its redware, or pottery made from red-toned clay. Curator Judy Barter.
Judy Barter:  It's exceptionally elaborate in its decoration, a lot of stamped bands of geometric designs. And the glazes are particularly beautiful, with those green swags and the little ruffles around the neck. So it's a very sophisticated piece of pottery, made by someone who was very dexterous. 
Narrator:  The center of the jar is stamped with the maker's name: E. W. Ferrar [ph?]. In this case, you will also see two fascinating examples of jugs shaped as faces. 
Judy Barter:  The two face jugs are examples of pottery made in the South, where anthropomorphic type forms were quite popular. And we think that some of these were made by slaves. 
Narrator:  By the mid-nineteenth century, ceramics were sometimes produced by slaves. Some were from Central Africa, where there was an important tradition of making jugs in human forms. The jugs may have been used for drinking, or even to place on graves. Face jugs were evidently very important possessions. Examples have been found all along the underground railroad, used by slaves escaping to the North."""
Manhattan Cocktail Set,701.mp3,"""<music>
Denise Mahoney:  The whole idea of a cocktail was definitely very new after Prohibition. People I believe.. it gave themselves an air of sophistication to be drinking cocktails. It was a very new thing, to be drinking out of this very streamline design. 
Narrator:  The great America designer Norman Bel Geddes, was inspired by the skyscrapers of New York City when he produced this jazzy cocktail set. Made from chrome-plated brass rather than silver, it's a showpiece of art deco. Denise Mahoney of the Art Institute's Department of American Art. 
Denise Mahoney:  It's also a useful piece too, it's not just a decoration. The Revere Copper and Brass Company were at this time trying to also figure out ways to make more money, because of the Depression. So they came out with this idea of a cocktail set as sort of.. a gift. Not too large, very simple, but still very striking. What I also find really interesting about the piece itself, the design, is how the cap on the cocktail shaker is also the cup, just with the addition of the stem and a base. So very economical in those terms as well.

In the Third Sleep,702.mp3,"""Narrator:  American-born Kay Sage is often identified as the wife of the French Surrealist Yves Tanguy. But she was an important artist in her own right, and took part in the historic 1938 Surrealist Exhibition in Paris, alongside better known Europeans such as Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, and Rene Magritte.
<music>
Narrator:  In the Third Sleep was painted during the height of Sage's career. The scenery, with its long, hard shadows, suggests an abandoned settlement out West. But it could easily be out West on another planet. The huge white drapery appears to be either unfolding and rising, or collapsing. On the far horizon, you can just make out what could be a mountain range. It's like the view from an airplane, still an uncommon experience in the mid-1940s. 
<music>
Narrator:  The Art Institute has an extensive collection of Surrealist art. Surrealism was more than an art movement, it was a philosophy aimed at liberating the mind, the individual self, and ultimately society. To the Surrealists, the unconscious mind was the ideal source of imagination. In the unconscious they found a dreamlike state that was truer than everyday reality."""
Ball Clock,703.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the years following the end of World War Two, American art and design began to show a very modern esthetic. Materials that had been restricted to industrial use, like chrome and aluminum, now became essential elements of forward-looking designs. Motifs such as circles, spheres and rods, brought to mind models of atomic structures. A perfect example is the electric clock on the wall in front of you. Here's the Art Institute's Brandon Rude. 
Brandon Rude:  It was one of the most popular designs of its time. George Nelson later rather ruefully commented that as a sort of all-time bestseller for Howard Miller, the Howard Miller Clock Company, suddenly it was decided by Mrs. America that this was the clock to put in your kitchen. Why the kitchen? I don’t know. But every ad that showed a kitchen for years after that, had a ball clock on it. Of course the clock's primary design was for offices, but it did become popular in the home and primarily in the kitchen."""
Armchair,704.mp3,"""Narrator:  Even though it's more than 50 years old, the design of this chair still looks completely fresh and modern. People call it the ""Tulip Chair,"" but to the designer, Eero Saarinen, this chair was one piece of his Pedestal Group. Like George Nelson, the designer of the ball clock often installed nearby, Saarinen was an architect who wanted to break from tradition. Brandon Rude, from the Art Institute's American Art Department. 
Brandon Rude:  Eero Saarinen wanted to free furniture design, modern 20th century furniture design, from.. over-stylization, over-ornamentation, and.. essentially create spare, simple, organic designs. And he referred to 18th and 19th century furniture design as having a slum of legs, and that of course meant that it was over-ornamented and overdesigned. He was interested in experimenting with contemporary, meaning mid-20th century, materials, such as plastic and fiberglass. He attempted a chair that had one single pedestal or leg, and have it created out of fiberglass or plastic. Unfortunately the technology of the time wouldn’t support this, and so ultimately this chair had the base made from aluminum so it could actually support the seat, and painted white to match the fiberglass chair."""
The Solitude of the Soul,705.mp3,"""<music>
Man 1:  The Solitude of the Soul shows four figures, two male, two female, united only by touch, their faces are turned away from each other. The artist, Lorado Taft, explained in a letter to a friend..
Man 2:  ""The thought is that however closely we may be thrown together, by circumstance, family ties, et cetera, we are unknown to each other. We grope, we cling to each other, but our eyes are hollow. Don’t think me a pessimist, I'm quite the contrary, life seems to me very beautiful. This group is merely one comment on it.""

Man 1:  Taft wrote one of the first histories of American sculpture, and was an important teacher at the school of the Art Institute. He also ran a summer colony called ""Eagles Nest"" in Oregon, Illinois, where artists could live and work together. The Solitude of the Soul won several awards, and led to commissions for other sculptures.

"Nydia, The Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii",706.mp3,"""Narrator:  The subject of this sculpture would have been instantly familiar to any reasonably well-read person in the 1850s. Here to give us the background is Brandon Rude, from the Art Institute's Department of American Art. 
Brandon Rude:  Nydia was a fictional character from Edward Bulwer-Lytton's immensely popular 1834 novel, The Last Days of Pompeii. In that story Nydia, the blind girl, was in love with Glaucus. 
<rumbling sound>
Brandon Rude:  And as Vesuvius erupted, she attempts to search for her companions using her astute hearing as her guide. You can see her bent over, her left hand covering her right ear to sharpen her senses. And then her stick guiding her along the way as the city, Pompeii, crumbles around her, evidenced by the broken column capital at her right foot. 
<crashing sound>
Narrator:  The subject, with its message of virtue and self-sacrifice, was so popular with Victorian viewers that Randolph Rogers produced almost a hundred versions of it in various sizes. A visitor to the sculptor's workshop in 1869 commented, ""I went to his studio and saw seven Nydias all in a row, all listening, all groping, and seven Italian marble-cutters at work, cutting them out. It was a gruesome sight."""""
Richard Bill,707.mp3,"""Narrator:  The subject of this vibrant portrait was a well-to-do Boston merchant and land speculator, named Richard Bill. The picture contains some clues to his profession. On the desk behind him you can see a quill pen and inkwell. He holds a letter in his hand, and there's another one on the desk, unopened and addressed to him. And there's a ship seen through the window, waiting to be loaded with cargo. Simply having his portrait painted is a sure sign of Richard Bill's prosperity. His long formal wig and ruffled shirt would have not have been worn by an average citizen. Look at the extravagant amount of velvet in his coat sleeves that fold back past the elbow, and the long vest underneath, which comes almost to his knees. And look at his pose, Richard Bill was a confident and powerful man. Equally interesting is the artist who portrayed him, John Smybert. After training in England, Smybert became the first painter of note in America. Also an architect, he completed the final design for Faneuil Hall in Boston, a city landmark still in use today. """
Dressing Table,708.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  If you could have looked into the bedroom of an American lady 250 years ago, you might have seen this lovely little table. The town of Salem, where it was made, was one of the most affluent places in the colonies. Its furniture was noted for its simple elegance and beautiful proportions. The overall style of this table is called ""Rococo"" with its graceful curves, and motifs of shells and other natural forms. The legs are each made from a single piece of mahogany, the form of the leg, with its elegant S-shaped curve, is known as ""cabriole."" The leg flares out at the very top, this is called the ""knee,"" and it narrows and curves in at the ankle, near the bottom, and then out again at the foot. If you dropped a straight line from any corner of the table down to the floor, you'd find that the feet line up exactly below the corners. But the flowing curve gives the illusion of a much wider stance.

Desk and Bookcase,709.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  In the early 1700s, Boston lawyers, accountants and merchants conducted their businesses from their homes. An impressive desk and bookcase like this was an essential tool. When open for business, it became an efficient workstation. The slanted top flipped down to provide a writing surface, two little shelves just under the mirrored doors, pulled out to hold candles. All manner of cubbyholes and small drawers held documents and account books. At the end of the business day, with the slant top and doors closed, it gave quiet testimony to its owner's wealth. The desk below and the bookcase above, are actually separate cabinets with carrying handles on the sides. The lavishly carved exterior surfaces are all made from costly imported mahogany. The hidden interior structure was built using less expensive domestic oak and pine."""
Bureau Table,710.mp3,"""Narrator:  200 years ago, the owners of this dressing table would have valued it for being both beautiful and practical. With drawers in various sizes, and a cabinet tucked underneath where they could have kept a wig stand. A visitor would have noticed the expensive use of mahogany, especially in the deeply curved front drawers, where so much wood was carved away. To historians, it's also valuable because of who made it. 
Ellen Roberts:  It's not actually signed, there's no label left, which is typical of much 18th century furniture. 
Narrator:  The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts. 
Ellen Roberts:  In this case though, because of construction details, and actually also details of the motifs on the front, you can tell that it is by John Townsend, who was one of the leading furniture manufacturers in Newport in the late 18th century. In particular, you see the three shell forms across the front, carved in this very bold way. But in the center of each shell is a.. basket, which is made with crosshatches and petals. And those are motifs that are found really only in Townsend's late work, so that's partly how we can tell that it's by him."""
Timepiece,711.mp3,"""<loud clock ticking>
Narrator:  Before the American Revolution, a clock in an American home was likely to be an impressive piece of cabinetry. And a tall one, because of the long hanging weights and pendulum that moved the gears behind the face. By the beginning of the 1800s new technology eliminated the need for weights, allowing for a smaller case, and helping to bring about a unique style of American clock-making. Because of its unusual shape, this type of clock is commonly called a ""Banjo Clock."" But its original name was, ""The Improved Timepiece."" The inventor, Simon Willard of Massachusetts, registered the design in 1801. This example was made in 1803, by Elnathan Taber. He had started as an apprentice at the age of 16 with the Willard family, and went on to become a notable clockmaker himself. Let's look more closely at his timepiece. It's in remarkably untouched condition, from the American eagle on top, to the bracket shelf underneath. The cabinet is made of wood, with applied ornamentation skillfully made from gesso and gilt. The scenes on the neck and base are made of glass panels painted from behind, an economical and durable alternative to enamel or porcelain. Also, notice the numbers on the clock's face, they're a departure from traditional Roman numerals that you can see on the tall clocks in these galleries."""
Major-General Henry Dearborn,712.mp3,"""Narrator:  The man staring out with such force from this painting is Major General Henry Dearborn, whose name is associated with Fort Dearborn here in Chicago. In fact there are quite a few forts named after him, appropriately for someone who served as Secretary of War under Thomas Jefferson. At the time of this portrait, Dearborn was a senior major general in the army, he was 61 years old, and actively engaged in the War of 1812. The clouds in the background, tinged with red, suggest the smoke and fire of war. The artist has skillfully captured Dearborn's energy and pugnacious attitude. But he's flattered his subject by making him appear merely robust, when in fact the general was quite overweight. The three-quarter profile pose helps to disguise the subject's broken nose and drooping jowls, which are more evident in other portraits. Gilbert Stuart was a successful portraitist, who had studied with Benjamin West in England. When he returned to America, one of this most famous clients was George Washington, whom he painted several times. When you look at a one-dollar bill, it is Gilbert Stuart's portrait of Washington that looks back at you."""
"Mrs. Andrew Bedford Bankson and Son, Gunning Bedford Bankson",713.mp3,"""Narrator:  The painter of this charming portrait was one of the earliest African American artists to be known by name and reputation. Joshua Johnson came to America as a slave from Saint-Dominique, now Haiti, and became a free man sometime before 1796. Johnson worked in Baltimore as a portrait painter, nevertheless, fear of capture by slave traders limited his ability to travel in search of commissions. As a result, most of his clients were from white middle-class families in Baltimore, many of whom were abolitionists. Johnson became particularly known for his sensitive depictions of children. The young mother in this painting wears a modest yet fashionable dress, trimmed with a delicate line of imported lace, and a double circle of pale glass beads in her hair. The child wears a necklace of coral beads and holds a strawberry, a delicacy Johnson often included in his portraits. Now this may surprise you, that child on Mrs. Bankson's lap is her son, Gunning Bedford Bankson, not her daughter. In the 19th century, children of both sexes were dressed almost identically as infants. They didn’t begin wearing boys' or girls' outfits until they were about six. """
"York Harbor, Coast of Maine",714.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Look at this painting for a while. You can just feel yourself slow down. It's done in a style that art historians now call ""Luminism,"" for its glowing light and clear definition of form. Martin Johnson Heade wanted to convey a sense of stillness and transcendence in his landscapes, and to encourage contemplation. 
Ellen Roberts:  For Heade, he's interested in.. these effects of light in atmosphere. 
Narrator:  Ellen Roberts, from the Art Institute's Department of American Art. 
Ellen Roberts:  Heade is an interesting character, because he painted the same motifs over and over and over again. He painted grain stacks, he painted the marshes especially, on the New England coast, over and over again. The compositions were extremely horizontal compared to a typical landscape of the time. Quite horizontal, which I think kind of accentuates the quiet that you see here. The New England seashore was becoming more and more populated at the time, there were more and more hints of industrialization. And as a result it's almost an idealized view here, where you still see the commerce, human commerce, in this case fishing, in harmony with the beautiful landscape, and not at war with it."""

Because they accused them of helping the Confederacy during the war, and thus prolonging the war. So they brought that case in front of three neutral arbitrators from Brazil, Switzerland and Italy. And so they came to Geneva in Switzerland and they met, and they decided that the British were indeed at fault, and that they would need to pay the Americans 15 million dollars in war reparations.

And so they came to Geneva in Switzerland and they met, and they decided that the British were indeed at fault, and that they would need to pay the Americans 15 million dollars in war reparations. So in gratitude for that, the Americans commissioned three identical sets of silver from Tiffany and Company. 
Narrator:  Among the figures on the silver set is Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. 
Ellen Roberts:  The center punch bowl has on it heads of Dionysus as the handles. On the wine coolers themselves you see the head of Silenus, who is Dionysus's most famous follower. The candlesticks have the figure of Ariadne, wife of Dionysus. Also on the wine coolers, each one has two mythological figures, one representing agriculture and the other representing commerce."""
Punch Bowl,715_4.mp3,"""Narrator:  If you read the label for this silver set, the first question you might ask is, ""What does that name mean? The Geneva Tribunal Testimonial."" The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts explains.

For Sunday's Dinner,716.mp3,"""Narrator:  This is a great example of what's called, ""Trompe-l'oeil,"" which is French for, ""Fool the eye."" These types of paintings were often seen in taverns and stores, as well as art galleries. This one was painted by William Harnett. 
Ellen Roberts:  Harnett is really the most famous American painter painting in that style in the late 19th century, some people would say the best one. 
Narrator:  The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts. 
Ellen Roberts:  It's an interesting choice <laughs> of motifs though, to paint in the trompe-l'oeil style. In this case I think there is an element of humor going on. Also there's an element of nostalgia, because Harnett's patrons at the time would have been in the city, he was painting for relatively wealthy people. But this subject is referring to a kind of country dinner, and the door itself is so old and decrepit it's kind of referring back to an idyllic country past. People really longed for that. One reading of this painting is the lock over there on the left, and it's slipping down, so you see behind it the unpainted door. He's kind of making a connection between that lock and the chicken itself, which has also been stripped of all of its covering, and you see its ugly flesh."""
View of Cotopaxi,717.mp3,"""Narrator:  In Ecuador, there's a volcano called Cotopaxi, and it held a strong attraction for the American painter Frederic Church. He traveled to South America to sketch it, and he painted it at least 10 times. His intention was to create a vision of paradise. The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts. 
Ellen Roberts:  Church was very influenced by the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. And von Humboldt had come out with a book called ""Kosmos"" in 1848, which many painters read. To look at a beautiful landscape like this, is to see proof of the existence of God. Von Humboldt encouraged painters like Church to go find these wilderness areas that still existed in the 19th century, so they're meant to remind you of the Garden of Eden, of earthly paradise. He tries to make the composition very readable. You have this palm tree that's clearly the foreground, and then you have the waterfall in the middle ground, and the volcano is in the background. So it's very easy for your eye to travel backward into the space, and understand it. 
Narrator:  Although Church's painting is very convincing, Cotopaxi was not surrounded by lush vegetation at all. The artist created a sort of ideal synthetic landscape, to better inspire the viewer."""
Girandoles,718.mp3,"""Narrator:  The term ""girandoles"" may not be familiar today, but it's simply a group of matched candleholders designed to stand in front of a mirror. Usually on a mantle shelf, so their light reflects back into the room. This set was produced around 1850, from a patented design by Cornelius and Company, the largest maker of girandoles in America. The factory in Philadelphia employed hundreds of workers and covered five floors. In these girandoles the prisms are cut glass, the bases are marble, and the figures are cast in bronze and gilded. In their style and materials, and even in the poses of the figures, they reflect the fashionable taste for the classical sculptures of Greece or Rome. The people shown here however, are not ancient gods, they're characters from James Fenimore Cooper's novel, The Last of the Mohicans, a late of adventure set during the French and Indian wars. At the center of the group here, we see the brave frontiersman, Nathaniel Bumppo, also known as ""Hawkeye,"" sitting on a fallen log. Beside him, gesturing like an ancient statue of Zeus and wearing what looks like a toga, is the chief of the Mohicans. His son, Uncas, stands behind them. The single figures off to either side, are the lovely and imperiled Cora Munro, and the heroic Major Heyward."""
Sideboard,719.mp3,"""Narrator:  Around the year 1800, Napoleon and his army entered Egypt, where they were fascinated by the ancient ruins they saw. The Western imagination seized on the engravings published by French artists in the campaign. Images of the splendid ruins became an inspiration for ladies' fashion, art, the opera, philosophy, and furniture. And that brings us to this sideboard. It was made in Philadelphia or Baltimore, for the home of Doctor and Mrs. Rich. The workmanship is of the highest order, using selected and expertly matched cuts of mahogany. The grain of the wood forms a decorative pattern of its own. Even more striking is the front of the large doors at either end, the raised panel on each door is wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. This shape is based on an Egyptian pylon, the immense entrance many stories high, to a huge temple or monument in Ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian reference is the claw feet below the pylons. Motifs like these were very much the fashion in the early 1800s."""
Machinist,720.mp3,"""Narrator:  On your right stands a machinist, and to the left his apprentice. There's more to these sculptures than might appear at first glance. Here's the Art Institute's Brandon Rude. 
Brandon Rude:  This is a pair created by Emma Stebbins as a complement and a contradiction to each other. They complement each other in that you have an older worker, a sort of father figure, and his younger apprentice. They contradict each other because they're also meant to represent the development of new machinery and new technology, supplanting older machinery and older technology. And this is evident in the old machinist's costume, in his hat, and with the types of tools that he holds. And compared with his young apprentice, who of course is shaven and fresh-cheeked, who holds in his hand a compass and a drawing stylus, meant to represent the introduction of possible new machines and new technology to the labor force. 
Narrator:  Emma Stebbins started her career as a painter. But she later became part of an expatriate community of American women sculptors working in Rome. At the time there was much debate about the impact of social and technological change. 
Brandon Rude:  Stebbins endows both figures with a sereneness that indicates that the older technology and the newer technology can coexist and complement one another."""
Armchair,721.mp3,"""Narrator:  At the time this impressive armchair was made, America was fascinated by all things Egyptian. This infatuation coincided with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and Verdi's tempestuous Egyptian-themed opera Aida, which came along two years later. 
<music>
Narrator:  The Egyptian revival was one of a wave of revival styles in mid-19th century American design, all of which referred back to earlier styles and foreign cultures. A chair like this summons up the imagined opulence of the Ancient Egyptian Empire. Notice the gilt details and the tapestry, originally much more colorful, with its depictions of a temple and hieroglyphs on the padded seat back. The new demand for upholstered furniture followed the invention of upholstery coil springs. The designers of this piece, the New York firm Pottier and Stymus, provided complete home interiors for clients such as Thomas Edison. They also furnished the president's office and cabinet room at the White House, for Ulysses S. Grant.
<music>"""
Cabinet,722.mp3,"""Narrator:  There is a strong Japanese influence in this American-made cabinet. The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts. 
Ellen Roberts:  After the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where the Japanese government had a section of the exhibition, Americans really fell in love with Japan. And so what Herter Brothers is doing, was evoking Japanese objects that they had seen. They use a technique called ""ebonizing,"" in which they paint the wood black so that it looks like a Japanese lacquer box. And the inlay suggests the kind of decoration you might have on a lacquer box that would have been in gold. 
Narrator:  The firm's chief designer in these years was Christian Herter, who had immigrated to the United States from Germany as a young man. 
Ellen Roberts:  He is using other motifs as well, like the Egyptian revival claw feet you see here <laughs>. This was the period of the Aesthetic Movement, designers like Christian Herter, who would freely combine these motifs from different cultures, as long as they still created a sense of overall harmony. Herter Brothers worked for the highly wealthy classes in New York, at the end of the 19th century. And a piece like this would cost an immense amount to make."""
Rainy Day,723.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  The painter Frank Weston Benson is best known for paintings of women and children relaxing in bright landscapes, or looking out to sea from breezy hilltops. His models were usually his own family, especially his three daughters Eleanor, Betty and Sylvia. Here, Benson has shown Betty indoors on a rainy afternoon. She sits apparently lost in thought, her book temporarily abandoned as she gazes toward the fireplace. Benson carefully arranged his pictures, and then posed his daughters in the scenes, a task they seem to have accepted with good humor. Like his sunlit exteriors, this work owes much to the French impressionists in its application of paint and blending of colors. We can see evidence of Benson's admiration for the Dutch master Vermeer. Look at the way the indirect light comes through the window at the rear, and reflects off the polished floor. The Delft pottery jar near the front of the composition is another nod to Vermeer."""
Vase,724.mp3,"""Narrator:  The shapes of these vessels are simple but graceful at the same time, the colors are muted and quiet. These features were typical of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 1890s. Look at the tall green vase at the back, it was made at the Rookwood studios, America's foremost art pottery at the end of the 19th century. Rookwood was founded in 1880 in Cincinnati, by Maria Longworth Nichols. She and her colleague, Mary Louise McLaughlin, developed techniques of painting and glazing that resulted in vessels like the one you see here. The Arts and Crafts movement placed a lot of emphasis on a straightforward, some said ""truthful,"" approach to materials, and valued handcrafted objects over machine produced goods. The movement attracted reformers and thinkers of both sexes, and some of the most innovative potters were women."""
"Nouvart Dzeron, A Daughter of Armenia",725.mp3,"""Narrator:  Ralph Elmer Clarkson's portrait of Nouvart Dzeron, was something of a departure for the Chicago artist. He was known for painting dignitaries, including a mayor, governor, college president, Nobel laureate, and secretary of war. Clarkson also took on many private commissions for wealthy patrons. 
<music>
Narrator:  However, this subject fell into none of those categories. When he completed this painting, Clarkson was a well-established mentor and an influential teacher at the Art Institute of Chicago. Nouvart Dzeron was a brilliant student there, and part of a proud Armenian family. Here she strikes a dramatic pose, wearing a costume sent to her by her grandfather from the village where she was born. The dramatic effect is heightened by the strong contrast of her silhouette with the background, and by brushwork that seems only half finished in places. Clarkson may have been inspired by the vogue from Middle-Eastern subjects at this time. This young woman, in her loose trousers and long braids, would have seemed exotic to many viewers. 
<music>"""
The Bronco Buster,727.mp3,"""Brandon Rude:  This was not only the first sculpture Frederic Remington ever made, but it was also the first heroic cowboy sculpture of its kind. 
Narrator:  Brandon Rude, Curator in the American Art Department. 
Brandon Rude:  Frederic Remington was best known during his lifetime as a painter and an illustrator. In 1892 he published a pen and ink drawing of a cowboy on a rearing horse, and this drawing served as the basis for the later Bronco Buster sculpture that you see here. In 1895 on the eve of producing Bronco Buster, Remington crowed, ""Did I tell you that I was about to become a great sculptor? If not, well damn my modesty, it is so.""
Narrator:  Remington was certainly a show-off, but he had good reason. 
Brandon Rude:  This is a complicate piece to produce, especially for somebody's first effort. Notice for example how the horse stands only on its two hind legs, and thus supports the very top-heavy cowboy and the front of the horse as it curves over. 
Narrator:  It's important to keep in mind that this sculpture was made in the late 1800s. 
Brandon Rude:  Remington worked at a time, and produced this piece, when America was becoming increasingly nostalgic over the West. So what Remington is serving up is a romanticized, nostalgic view of the American cowboy and the American West."""
Picture of Dorian Gray,728.mp3,"""Narrator:  We're going to look at two paintings by Ivan Albright. To give us some background, here's the Art Institute's Sarah Kelly. 
Sarah Kelly:  Albright is definitely a well-known Chicago artist. He actually grew up going to the Art Institute of Chicago, and he studied at the School of the Art Institute. He gave his entire collection to the Art Institute in 1977, because of his strong association with the city itself. Even though he was a Chicago painter, he had very much a national reputation. 
Narrator:  The painting in front of you is called, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" You may be familiar with the book by Oscar Wilde, in which a beautiful young man never grows old, while his portrait ages and decays instead. 
Sarah Kelly:  Most people look at this painting and are sort of shocked by its goriness, and by this radical use of almost neon colors. This was actually commissioned for a movie, MGM Studios was creating the movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray in the 1940s. And they asked Ivan Albright to paint the ""after"" version of the painting, which you do not see throughout the entire movie, until at the very end suddenly you see it in technicolor. Albright had been experimenting with color, and with The Picture of Dorian Gray he knew that it would be filmed under studio lights. And so he significantly sort of intensified the color here, so that you would look at the color, and if you looked away you would have an after-image sort of burned on your retina from these incredibly intense colors. 
Narrator:  The mysterious painting typically on view nearby is called, ""The Door."" But it's full title is, ""That which I should have done, I did not do."" With all its meticulous details, the painting took 10 years to complete. It's considered Ivan Albright's masterpiece. 
Sarah Kelly:  In many ways, this is a Vanitas painting, a meditation on death and decay. I'm fascinated by the composition itself, it sort of almost bulges out in the center, so you have this very discordant sense of space. It has this very claustrophobic effect to it. By all accounts, Albright was an incredibly sort of.. fun and mischievous person, which I think is directly counter to our experience of him as a painter."""
The Weaver,730.mp3,"""Narrator:  The Mexican muralist Diego Rivera was one of the most important artists of the 1930s. Early in his career he had worked in Paris, but he returned to his homeland to support the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910. In Mexico, Rivera abandoned the cubism he'd been experimenting with, and moved toward a figurative style he believed could more effectively communicate and celebrate his national heritage. Here's the Art Institute's Sarah Kelly. 
Sarah Kelly:  At this point, by 1936, he was very interested in an indigenous craft of Mexico, which gets played up in his murals but as well in the easel paintings. And so here he's taken this well-known weaver, whose name was Luz Jimenez, and shown her in his studio weaving. And she's using a back strap loom, which is very traditional.. way of weaving in Mexico at the time. You get this wonderful profile of her face and of her hair, against the white wall behind. And then you have this dynamic line of her back strap loom crossing across the entire composition. And then similar forms are picked up between the diagonals of the fabric and the diagonals of the yarn winder below, which are then contrasted with all of the sort of very soft folds of the fabric that she's actually wearing. It's this wonderful sort of solemn and dignified painting."""
Jazz Bowl,731.mp3,"""<music>
Denise Mahoney:  I think what's wonderful about this piece, is as you go around it and you look-- you're a witness to an evening out in New York, New York City. 
<music>
Narrator:  The Art Institute's Denise Mahoney. 
Denise Mahoney:  The artist was recalling an evening he spent at the Cotton Club when he was designing this bowl. 
Narrator:  Take a stroll through the city night, as you walk around this bowl. Notice the street lamps and the neon signs, look for skyscrapers and a stoplight. That big object that looks like a fan? It's the Wurlitzer organ at Radio City Music Hall. The style is an energetic mix of cubism and popular imagery. 
<music>
Narrator:  And you can almost hear the music that inspired the designer, Viktor Schreckengost. 
Denise Mahoney:  What I think makes the piece sort of humorous, is that you see champagne glasses, liquor bottles. And you have to think that it was still Prohibition when this bowl was being made.. for the governor of New York. And yet the artist still felt it was okay to include references to alcohol in this jazz bowl. 
Narrator:  That's right. This punch bowl was a gift to celebrate the reelection of the governor of New York State, future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And it was commissioned by his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. 
<music>"""
Silver Sun,732.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Although the title of this painting, ""Silver Sun,"" refers to the natural world, Arthur Dove was not interested in literal representation in his work. He was one of the first Americans to paint completely abstract images, following an eye-opening trip to Paris in the first decade of the 20th century. Here, roughly concentric circles fill the area where the sky would be. A dark, slightly curved shape sits at the bottom, like a horizon. The work almost hums with visual vibration, and glistens with real metallic paint. 
<music>
Narrator:  The artist enjoyed a long friendship with Alfred Stieglitz, the collector, art dealer and photographer. It was a productive working relationship, one that offered Dove both financial security and public exposure. Stieglitz's wife, Georgia O'Keeffe, gave the Art Institute a portion of Stieglitz's collection, including many of Dove's works spanning his entire career. You can see several examples in this gallery."""
Madawaska—Acadian Light-Heavy,733.mp3,"""Narrator:  Marsden Hartley was one of the most inventive American artists in the early 20th century. He moved through a number of avant-garde styles, but by the late 1930s he was creatively and emotionally exhausted. He retreated to his native Maine. There he turned to new subjects, like this portrait of a boxer, a man of Acadian or French Canadian descent, from the town of Madawaska, Maine. Here's the Art Institute's Brandon Rude. 
Brandon Rude:  These nude figurative paintings of Hartley's later career have a strong masculine overtone, and this is a result of the country going to war. Masculine imagery, the image of the soldier, a superman. And these paintings, rather than identified for their homoerotic subject matter, became identified with the strong, virile American male. 
Narrator:  You can see traces of cubism in the masklike face, and the geometric forms of the body. The strong contrasts of color and light recall the influence of expressionism. 
Brandon Rude:  This painting was offered to the museum in the 1960s, but the homoerotic overtones were considered too controversial by the museum board and the board of trustees, and it was rejected. The curator of 20th century painting, James Speyer, purchased it for himself and upon his death gave it as a gift to the museum."""
Miss Expanding Universe,734.mp3,"""Narrator:  ""Something like a starfish and something like a woman."" That was how Time Magazine's art critic described it in 1932. We're talking about the sculpture by Isamu Noguchi, hanging above you. 
Brandon Rude:  The motivation for it was apparently a meeting that occurred between Noguchi and Ruth Page, at the Arts Club of Chicago in the 1930s. 
Narrator:  The Art Institute's Brandon Rude. 
Brandon Rude:  Ruth Page of course was the famous modern dancer, well known for her very bold, large, expressive movements, and also the use of fabric on the stage. Supposedly Noguchi and Page were seated directly behind one another at an event, they struck up a conversation. Noguchi told her that he always wanted to portray her in one of his sculptures, and so created Miss Expanding Universe, which was the title of one of Page's dances. Ruth Page held on to this sculpture for a number of years, and eventually gave it to the museum in 1994. 
Narrator:  Noguchi explained his feelings about this sculpture, ""So much modern stuff is so bitter, so hopeless, to me at least. Miss Expanding Universe is full of hope."""""
Ceres,736.mp3,"""Man 1:  Does this little statue look familiar? It's the model for the much larger version, which stands 35 feet tall, on top of the historic Chicago Board of Trade building, on LaSalle Street. It's an example of the art deco style, a sleek, streamlined aesthetic of the 1920s. When the sculptor John Storrs received this commission, he recalled..
Man 2:  ""I had two major points to consider. First, I wanted my work to be in architectural harmony with the building. Second, I wanted it to be symbolical of the business. The first point I have accomplished through treating the subject in an extremely modern manner. The vertical lines of the building are retained in the lines of the statue. Because of the great height at which it will stand, the outline of a woman's figure is suggested, rather than rendered exactly.""
Man 1:  To symbolize the business carried out at the Board of Trade, the artist chose Ceres, the Roman goddess of the harvest. In one hand she holds a sheaf of wheat, in the other a bag of grain. Both refer to the building's function as the world's most important food trading market. The larger statue, made of aluminum, stands 600 feet above the sidewalk. Until 1965, it was the tallest point in Chicago."""
Woman (Elevation),737.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the years since this arresting sculpture was first seen by the public, it's been described as both an idealized image of woman in general, and a sensuous portrait of one woman in particular, Isabelle Nagel. When Gaston Lachaise first met Nagel, he was a successful artist working and exhibiting in Paris. She was married and living in Boston. He followed her to America in 1906. Nagel eventually divorced her husband to marry Lachaise in 1917. The artist began preparing sketches and photos for Woman (Elevation) as early as 1912. Over the next four years, he produced models in clay and then plaster. The bronze you see here was made around 1928, and came to the Art Institute in 1943. It was originally owned by Nagel herself. In his own words, Lachaise depicted his wife as, ""Upstanding, noble, bountiful, poised on her toes, with closed, self-absorbed eyes, nearly detached from Earth."""""
At Moquin's,738.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Without a little background, it might be hard to understand the scandal this casual-looking restaurant scene caused when it was first exhibited. So let's have a closer look. 
<music>
Narrator:  The man in the painting was James B. Moore, a lawyer who enjoyed the company of artists and writers. The fashionable woman beside him has been identified as the wife of restaurant owner Olly Mouquin. Is she turning away from the man in boredom? Or has something outside the picture caught the eye of them both? The artist, William Glackens, deliberately left their relationship ambiguous. In addition, the public objected to the casual proximity of the patrons in the restaurant, and to the undisguised display of alcohol on an otherwise almost empty table. A critic in the Chicago Post commented with disapproval, ""The man does not look like a prohibitionist."" Glackens' painting was called sensationalist and vulgar. But with its loose and rapidly rendered brushwork, asymmetrical composition and vivid colors, it places us in the thick of a lively evening among New York's bohemians. 
<music>"""
The Two Disciples at the Tomb,739.mp3,"""Narrator:  The Art Institute's Denise Mahoney. 
Denise Mahoney:  And what I find interesting about his religious pictures, is the light is very important. The focus is almost off the painting, it's what's happening to the lower left as these disciples are contemplating what has happened, as they look into Christ's tomb and see that he is not there. 
Narrator:  The artist Henry Tanner was a devout Christian, who moved to Paris in search of artistic opportunities, unavailable to him as an African American in the United States. 
Denise Mahoney:  Henry Tanner was born in the East Coast in the United States, African American, son of a prominent minister. Knew from an early age that he did want to be an artist, but encountered a great deal of.. racial discrimination during his education and afterwards. He first went to Paris in 1891 and studied there, came back in 1893 just for a short time, less than a year. And then after that returned to Paris to live permanently. He was commercially successful, he wanted to do these religious subjects and stayed very focused. But at the same time, his art was welcomed and he did find.. a great deal of openness in France, not only based on race but also based on what he wanted to paint."""
Nocturne: Blue and Gold - Southampton Water,741.mp3,"""Narrator:  To take us through this work by James McNeill Whistler, we've called on the Art Institute's Sarah Kelly. She starts with the painting's original title, which was simply, ""Nocturne: Blue and Gold.""
Sarah Kelly:  He chose the word ""nocturne"" because it has associations with music. He wanted to remove any suggestion that his painting had narrative to it. It's important to notice how flattened this composition is. Instead of suggesting a recession into depth, he instead creates a high horizon line, which tilts the composition upwards in your reading of it, so that there's almost no depth whatsoever. He painted very thinly, and he was actually using very thinned down oil pigment, like a stain, which is why in fact you can often see the canvas showing through so prominently. He would then blur those forms, I think with a rag, so that for example when you see those ships at the upper right-hand corner, you can see how obscured they are. He then went on to add these dots of yellow pigment as a way of punctuating, I would say, the composition. 
Narrator:  Whistler's style was boldly original for his time, almost verging on abstraction. 
Sarah Kelly:  And what always amuses me about Whistler is that these were shocking at the time to his audience, they were absolutely shocking. And his paintings would get hung upside down because people didn’t know what to make of them."""
Arrangement in Flesh Color and Brown: Portrait of Arthur Jerome Eddy,742.mp3,"""Narrator:  For James McNeill Whistler, the title of a painting really mattered. 
Sarah Kelly:  You'll notice that Whistler titled this portrait, ""Arrangement in Flesh Color and Brown,"" and only then has the subtitle, ""Portrait of Arthur Jerome Eddy."" He wanted to emphasize that it was simply a chosen arrangement of line and of color, rather than Arthur Jerome Eddy. And Eddy was very much agreeable to this. 
Narrator:  Sarah Kelly, Associate Curator at the Art Institute of Chicago. 
Sarah Kelly:  Arthur Jerome Eddy is a very important person to the Art Institute of Chicago. He was a Chicago lawyer, and he saw Whistler's works at the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition here in Chicago, where Whistler actually was given center stage. And he was so impressed that he went off and asked Whistler to paint his portrait. He then went from championing Whistler to championing modern art. He became a very influential collector of modern paintings, so the core collection of German expressionist painting came from Arthur Jerome Eddy. He also published a book about modern art. So he was very influential in promoting modern art in America, and particularly in Chicago."""
Bust of a Youth (Saint John the Baptist?),750.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Bruce Boucher, Curator of European sculpture. 
Bruce Boucher:  Francesco Mochi's Bust of a Youth is one of our signature pieces, and it is one of the most beautiful Baroque sculptures in the collection. It shows a youth, an adolescent, with corkscrew curls and drapery that suggests he may or may not be the young Saint John the Baptist. But it is a portrait of adolescence, he has a rather dreamy expression and his lips are parted as if he is about to speak, or has just said something. It's the kind of animated expression that Baroque sculptors like Mochi would use, to try to transcend the limitations of marble as a medium. 
<music>
Bruce Boucher:  He could carve marble like butter. And if you look at these curls, you could put your finger through them, they are really a tour de force of sculpture. What is Baroque about this, is the way in which.. the sculptor is trying to engage us in a kind of imaginary discourse with the sitter. The figure's head is turned sharply to the side, his eyes are focused, his mouth is open. There's a sense of movement about it, which distinguishes it from a Renaissance sculpture, which would probably have been much more passive and less engaged with us as spectators."""
Pietà,751.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  This Pieta, or lamentation of the Virgin Mary over the dead Christ, is by the 17th century Italian sculptor Filippo Parodi. It is a wonderful example of Baroque art, whose dramatic forms aim to engage both the heart and mind of the viewer. Curator of European sculpture, Bruce Boucher. 
Bruce Boucher:  What we see is the body of Christ taken down from the cross, spent, dead, the signs of the Crucifixion are being held by the little puto [ph?] on the lower right. And above the body of Christ, his mother is weeping over him, you see tears in her eyes. The whole thing is taking art and raising it to a higher pitch, to a much more urgent style in which we are supposed to be moved. We feel with the Virgin, her sorrows, her sufferings. Also the way in which her drapery is agitated, and the drapery around the Christ seems to amplify the feeling of loss and desolation. All of that is really part of the way in which Baroque artists, particularly sculptors, would convey the inner turmoil of religious figures in a scene like this."""
Adam,752.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Adam and Eve turn toward each other in this wonderful pair of Renaissance panels. They were painted in the 1530s, by Lucas Cranach the Elder, who was court painter to the ruler of Saxony in Germany. Cranach's paintings are known for their courtly elegance, here we see this in the graceful, flowing outlines of Adam and Eve's bodies. Notice how Cranach deepens this effect by depicting their pale bodies against dark green foliage. We might wonder what kind of setting this pair of panels was intended for. Martha Wolff is the Eleanor Wood Prince Curator of European painting before 1750.
Martha Wolff:  Is it a moral guide? Is it in the tradition of the power of women? Because after all, Eve is the one who took the first bite of the apple and she's about to hand it to Adam. So there's something both moralizing and slightly provocative about the way he treats these figures. They were obviously meant to go quite close together, because the tree that-- the tree of the knowledge and good and evil, is divided between the two panels, and so is mean to be seen as continuous. So they were probably just used as a pair, perhaps in a humanist library.

Eve,752_1.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  Adam and Eve turn toward each other in this wonderful pair of Renaissance panels. They were painted in the 1530s, by Lucas Cranach the Elder, who was court painter to the ruler of Saxony in Germany. Cranach's paintings are known for their courtly elegance, here we see this in the graceful, flowing outlines of Adam and Eve's bodies. Notice how Cranach deepens this effect by depicting their pale bodies against dark green foliage. We might wonder what kind of setting this pair of panels was intended for. Martha Wolff is the Eleanor Wood Prince Curator of European painting before 1750.

Old Man with a Gold Chain,753.mp3,"""Narrator:  The great Dutch artist Rembrandt made this painting in about 1631. Martha Wolff, Eleanor Wood Prince Curator of European Painting before 1750. 
Martha Wolff:  This is a sort of fantasy portrait. It is of a sitter who appears in many early pictures by Rembrandt. He seems to have been a man with picturesque features, who Rembrandt could recast in different characters. And so he dresses him up in a big velvet beret that is really the costume of about a hundred years earlier, and a plumed feather in the beret, and a steel gorget, a little neck protector, to evoke a military hero. It's a character study and a grand statement of what Rembrandt can do, at the point when he is leaving his birthplace in Leiden and going to set himself up in Amsterdam, in the metropolis. 
Narrator:  There, Rembrandt would establish himself as one of the preeminent artists of his period. Notice how dramatic light and shadow define the man's face. 
Martha Wolff:  Also typical of him in this early period, is the very fine, delicate stippling and modeling of the face in the light, with little small strokes and fine painting style. So he's using the light and this rather miniaturist technique at this point, to create almost a map of the face."""
The Holy Family with Saints Elizabeth and John the Baptist,754.mp3,"""<music>
Narrator:  In the center of this painting the Virgin Mary tenderly holds the Christ Child, as the infant John the Baptist leans into her lap. Peter Paul Rubens made the painting around 1615, skillfully transforming a traditional religious subject into a family scene, full of life and warmth. Marth Wolff, Eleanor Wood Prince Curator of European Painting before 1750. 
Martha Wolff:  The studies of the children are beautifully worked out. Especially the Christ Child, with his sort of sidelong glance as he's involved with his mother, and yet also looking down at his little cousin. And these figures are very probably drawn from his own experience of his own large family. 
Narrator:  Rubens' rich colors add to the painting's liveliness. Notice how he contrasts the rosy creaminess of the baby's skin, with delicate blue-tone shadows. And Christ's stomach glows with the reflection of his mother's red dress, which Rubens has modeled on a fashionable style of his own time. But the painting also contains solemn reminders of Christ's momentous destiny. The lamb, petted by Mary's husband Joseph, symbolizes Christ's future sacrifice for the sake of mankind, while the clouds outside hint at dark shadows to come.

Still Life with Game Fowl,755.mp3,"""Narrator:  <audio clip begins> The fruits, vegetables and game birds in this still life are painted with an extraordinary intensity. Framed by a stone window, they are illuminated by a penetrating light that reveals every detail of their surface and texture. The utterly black background throws their forms into even sharper focus. Against this darkness, the objects are arranged with an elegant sense of geometry and rhythm. The birds are hung, a traditional way to store them after hunting, in a row from smallest to largest. Their grouped bodies form a triangle within the window frame which is matched by another created by the fruits and vegetables. Notice how the artist increases our sense of the objects' presence by trompe l'oeil or tricking the eye, making it seem as though some of them extend out into our space. <audio clip ends> The painting was made around 1600 by Juan Sanchez Cotan, who lived and worked in the City of Toledo in central Spain. Curator Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  He's an extraordinarily gifted painter of still life whose works are very rare. And there's a wonderful insight into him to be gained from remembering that he left his worldly work as a painter when he was in his early forties and went and joined a Carthusian monastery as a lay brother."""
The Ecstasy of Saint Francis,756.mp3,"""<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  This dramatic painting is called ""The Ecstasy of St. Francis."" Curator Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  Well, this picture shows St. Francis in a state of ecstasy and it really also through its form evokes the swirl of feelings of that state, I think. But we see the saint in his rough habit, and he's been meditating upon mortality with the skull that he holds.
Narrator:  As he meditates, the angel dressed in blue and white appears to him, holding a cross, spear and crown of thorns, which represent Christ's passion and death. This momentous vision causes Francis to swoon, supported by another angel.
Martha Wolff:  This picture is particularly interesting because it's viewed as a very important statement of the Roman art world in the beginning of the 17th century when Caravaggio was a major figure who was just starting to state his kind of revolutionary realist dramatic rhetorical form of art. And Bellini was an established artist who picked up what Caravaggio was doing, and this is in 1601, is his first and almost most Caravaggesque statement. The dramatic light that one sees that falls on the saint and illuminates the angels so starkly is really what he's learned from Caravaggio. It gives it an emotional intensity.

Trompe-l'Oeil Still Life with a Flower Garland and a Curtain,757.mp3,"""Narrator:  Painted in the Netherlands in 1658, this masterly still life held a fascinating secret for many years. Curator Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  This painting is signed by Adriaen van der Spelt, a still life painter whose work is rather rare. But fairly recently, we realized that it's in fact a collaboration between van der Spelt and a more famous painter named Frans van Mieris who contributed the beautiful blue satin curtain that is drawn across part of the picture.
Narrator:  The young artists had both just joined the Painters Gild in the City of Leiden, so this picture was probably a demonstration in their skill in the art of illusion.
Martha Wolff:  And also a reflection of actual usage at the time, because Dutch collectors would use curtains to protect particularly exquisite pictures from light and also to give the viewer the thrill of pulling back the curtain and seeing what was displayed behind it. And you have multiple layers of illusion here because you have first the stone arch and then you have the garland that's draped in front of it, and then you have the curtain. And one of the most wonderful things is really the brass rod which plays off of the frame of the picture. It stands in front of it."""
Landscape with Saint John on Patmos,758.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the foreground of this serene landscape, St. John the Evangelist sits writing the Book of Revelation, the visionary last book of the New Testament in the Christian Bible. An eagle, St. John's traditional symbol, stands behind him. The saint himself represents the advent of the new Christian faith which will replace the fallen pagan beliefs alluded to by the classical ruins around him. The painting was made by the great 17th century French artist Nicolas Poussin in Rome, where he spent much of his working life. This is a perfect example of Poussin's idealized classical landscapes, which he constructs with a sense of clarity and geometry. Notice how the path behind St. John zigzags its way back into the middle distance, the trees diminishing in size to help create a sense of depth. Meanwhile, the upright form of the classical pedestal near the saint is echoed by that of the tall tree behind it, and again by the ancient temple columns and obelisks in the distance. Poussin's work was highly appreciated by cultivated classically educated collectors among the Roman and French aristocracy. Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  He and his admirers were very much drawn to a stoic philosophy, and so the rationality of the landscape and the calmness of it were probably very appealing."""
Are They Thinking about the Grape? (Pensent-ils au raisin?),759.mp3,"""Narrator:  ""Are They Thinking About the Grape?"" asks the title of this charming pastoral scene. The answer clearly is no. Their thoughts are of love and desire. The painting is by French 18th century artist Francoise Boucher, who invented this kind of idyllic rustic love scene. Boucher drew this particular subject from Parisian pantomime or popular theater of the time. Curator Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  The pantomime deals with the little shepherd and his love, Lisette, and the small obstacles that are put in the way of their love and how they triumph. The shepherd and shepherdess are relaxing in a landscape. They're dressed simply. Their feet are bare. But nevertheless, they're quite elegant, and their sheep and goats are scattered all around them looking very comfy and untroublesome.
Narrator:  Boucher responded astutely to the expanding market for fine and decorative arts in 18th century France, putting his artistic talents to extremely diverse uses.
Martha Wolff:  Boucher was a tremendously prolific and accomplished painter, a painter to the king but also a painter who understood the usefulness of the multiplication of his designs. Here he draws on contemporary pantomime. His designs in turn were reused in the Gobelins tapestry production and in porcelain production and were very much part of contemporary culture."""
"The Grand Canal, Venice",760.mp3,"""Narrator:  Beneath a wide sky whose misty clouds hint at the changeable weather of Venice, businesses carried on as usual on the Grand Canal. Citizens visit the great baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute on the right, while black gondolas and commercial barges ply their trade on the water. To the left, we can see the large pinkish-colored palace of the Doge or ruler of Venice. The scene is by Francesco Guardi, who followed in the Venetian tradition of making vedute or views of the city, primarily intended for sale to wealthy foreign tourists. Bruce Boucher, curator of European sculpture.
Bruce Boucher:  I always think that the best explanation for this kind of painting is a remark made by the great German poet Goethe who visited Venice in 1786, and he said, ""Whenever I step out of doors, I seem to see the latest and best painting of the Venetian school."" And in effect, what we're seeing here is what Goethe would have seen, what anyone today can still see, and that is the city on view, on parade, the city as a subject of auto celebration. And the whole idea of creating a city in the middle of the lagoon was and still remains something of a wonder of the world."""
Milton Dictating to his Daughter,761.mp3,"""Narrator:  In this painting, the great 17th century English poet Milton composes his famous epic poem ""Paradise Lost."" The poem tells of the rebel angels led by Satan, who rise up against God and are cast out of heaven. At this point in his life, Milton had gone blind, but he continued to create poetry by dictating lines as he created them to his daughter. The painting, made in 1794, is by the Swiss born artist Henry Fuseli, who spent most of his working life in England. Fuseli is known for his interest in the power of dreams and of the imagination. Art Institute Director Douglas Druick.
<audio clip begins>
Douglas Druick:  Here you see the poet and his sightless eyes are turned upwards as if he's anticipating or drawing on the inspiration for his poem, and he is dictating it to his middle daughter. There's a shaft of light that falls on her that illuminates the paper on which she's writing. It's a glimmer of light in the darkness of Milton's life, but it's so to suggest an inspiration, perhaps divine."""
Portrait of General José Manuel Romero,762.mp3,"""Narrator:  Spanish artist Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes painted this portrait of a government dignitary in about 1810. Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom:  Obviously, this is a person of importance, and I think Goya's ability to show that is the way he presents him against a completely stark background. He's almost overwhelmed by the decorations that he carries. He was a minister of justice, a minister of the interior, so he had these high government positions, and so he's wearing the different medals and the ribbon that indicate how far he's risen. And Goya's really setting those off with this wonderful red sash and the gold. And I think his pose, too. That was a popular pose at the time, that hand in the waistcoat, and the way he's just looking very serious but he's not confronting us. He's just kind of lost in his thoughts.
Narrator:  This pose may look familiar from portraits of the French Emperor Napoleon. Napoleon imposed French rule in Spain in 1808, just before this portrait was made and the sitter, although Spanish, was sympathetic to this political situation. Goya was opposed to French rule. Nevertheless, he painted several portraits of members of the new regime on commission.
Gloria Groom:  Even then, though, I don't think any of his political feelings come out. I think he took his job very seriously."""
Fishing Boats with Hucksters Bargaining for Fish,763.mp3,"""<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  The British artist J.M.W. Turner was fascinated by the sea and returned to it as a subject throughout his life. Art Institute Director Douglas Druick.
Douglas Druick:  The sea is a subject that allows you to explore light and color, to explore the atmospheric conditions which he loved to try to depict in his painting. The sky is a great tour de force in terms of the suggestion of the various moods of nature from ominous in those dark, dark clouds to the left, to the more nurturing blue that one sees through the break in the clouds. And I think one of the great wonders of this picture is the way that when you stand before it, you get the sense of the great surges and swells of the sea and you can almost feel like you're standing on board.
<audio clip ends>
Narrator:  On this horizon is a steam ship. At this time, the 1830s, steam power was a fairly new technology. During the 19th century it would revolutionize seafaring, liberating sailors to some extent from the vagaries of nature."""
"Amédée-David, the Comte de Pastoret",764.mp3,"""Narrator:  Elegantly silhouetted against a green interior, Comte de Pastoret surveys the world with an air of superiority in this portrait by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom:  Well, I think it's interesting, when this was exhibited officially right after he painted it, people thought that he looked dead, that he was lifeless, and they made fun not only of the way it was painted, but of the sitter. This is a portrait of a man who thinks he's very important, and you can see that in his kind of swagger pose and the way he's showing off everything. I mean, if you look at his legendenere, [ph?] he's got that cross, and then he's got this wonderful alabaster and gold sword hilt, and then he has these wonderful kid gloves next to him. It's very symbiotic, their relationship, because Ingres painted him at a time when this fellow had helped him get into an important academy, and at the same time, the Count was looking to Ingres to help him confirm his place in the art and literature world, so he was very anxious to be portrayed by an artist who was so well respected."""
Stoke -by-Nayland,765.mp3,"""<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  The English artist John Constable painted this wonderfully fresh view of a village in his native Eastern England in 1836, just a year before his death. Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom:  What you're aware of when you stand in front of this painting is the brush strokes, and you're aware of the incredible textures. For example, the texture of the trees might flow over to describe the people, so that there's this sense of integration of figure to ground. There's a sense of being there, the dewiness of this morning, the wetness, the heaviness of the moisture on the trees.
Narrator:  Scholars still debate whether this freely brushed painting was intended as a preparatory sketch for one of Constable's six foot landscapes, or whether he considered it finished in itself.
Gloria Groom:  I tend to think it really is finished, because everything is there and it's all so beautifully harmonized. It's also just an incredibly moving painting. It is such a non-descript place and yet somehow he ennobles it with the size of the painting, but also in this incredible interest in the way the atmosphere impacts on this landscape at that time. You just feel what he called he was going to do a sunny morning, an early morning after the rains painting, and that's exactly the feeling you get, and you think how did he translate that into paint.
<audio clip ends>"""
Jesus Mocked by the soldeirs,766.mp3,"""Narrator:  Edouard Manet's painting of Jesus mocked by Roman soldiers before his crucifixion is extraordinary in many ways. Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom:  By the 1860s when Manet paints this, there were very few artists who were still taking on Biblical subjects. You have the beginning of an Impressionist subject matter, modern life subject matter, so this was a really odd thing for the artist who prided himself on being a man of the moment. What he's done is he's taken a very traditional text and he's made it incredibly provocative and modern.
Narrator:  Manet referred to Jesus rather than Christ in the painting's title, emphasizing his ordinary humanity rather than his divinity, and his portrayal of Jesus seems deliberately anti-heroic.
Gloria Groom:  And if you look closely at this painting you'll see that his figure for Christ is made out of these incredibly thick concentric circles which he uses continuously around the legs, around the abdomen, around the shoulders, around the muscles. And it's very modern. And the critics were horrified."""
Peasants Bringing Home a Calf Born in the Fields,767.mp3,"""Narrator:  When this quiet scene of peasants carrying home a calf born in the field was exhibited in Paris in 1864, it proved extraordinarily controversial. Art Institute Director Douglas Druick.
<audio clip begins>
Douglas Druick:  What seems to have enraged the critics of the time and earned the artist, Jean-Francois Millet, a lot of criticism was the subject and the way the subject was depicted. What bothered the critics was that they thought the scene was treated much too solemnly. I think the problem for many of the critics was that in a way, Millet idealized aspects of French peasant life. In other words, the attachment to nature and the almost spiritual quality of that, at the same time that he emphasized how difficult these lives were. And one gets a sense of that heaviness of their load. It's not just the literal heaviness of the calf that they're bearing, but there's the sense in the way the figures are bowed and their heads are down that the life that they lead is one which is grinding and which is very difficult.
<audio clip ends>
Narrator:  Millet painted the picture at a time of considerable political instability in France, so his realistic scenes of peasant life emphasizing both its heroism and its hardships seemed deeply subversive to an urban, upper class audience."""
Beata Beatrix,768.mp3,"""<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  A poem by the Italian medieval poet Dante inspired this painting. The poem tells of Dante's great love, Beatrice, who dies young. We see Beatrice as she is about to enter the spirit world. She leans forward, transfixed, as a holy bird drops a white poppy into her lap symbolizing her approaching transformation. The painting's format echoes that of a medieval Italian church altarpiece with its main image above and smaller narrative panel below, all contained within a splendid gold leaf pane. In the lower panel, Dante finds Beatrice once again in the spirit world. The painting is by Dante Gabrielle Rossetti. Rossetti belonged to a group of young English artists called the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who wanted to return to pre-Renaissance ways of painting. 
<audio clip ends>
Narrator:  Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom:  But Rossetti was different because he really was a poet and he looked to literature and poetry for his subject matter and almost for his philosophy of life. So in a way, it's very poignant because his own life in some ways paralleled that poem in the sense that his model for this is his wife who had died ten years ago before he began painting this."""
Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra,769.mp3,"""Narrator:  In a rocky grotto, the classical hero Hercules faces the monstrous Lernean Hydra, which he must kill as one of his 12 labors. Around the Hydra are strewn the gruesome remains of its previous victims. The painting is by Gustave Moreau, who chose to depict the moment of absolute calm and stillness before the fight begins. Moreau reinforced this feeling by placing a long view out to the calm sea between the opponents. Art Institute Director Douglas Druick.
Douglas Druick:  His attempt was not only to suggest the two opposing figures, but to also suggest the two opposing principles, the forces of light represented by this figure of Hercules who was almost depicted like the Sun God Apollo, and the forces of darkness which are suggested by not only the gloomy surround in which this combat takes place, but also these black snakes that one sees in the form of the Hydra. This place in Lerna where the battle takes place was the gateway to the Netherworld, so it really is about light versus dark, good versus evil, and of course, Hercules will prevail.

Diptych with the Virgin and Child Enthroned and the Crucifixion,770.mp3,"""Narrator:  Christina Nielsen, Assistant Curator for Medieval Art.
Christina Nielsen:  This is an incredibly rare and important early panel painting in our collection, because it was painted in what's known as the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, which was the Crusader Kingdom that Europeans held in Palestine from 1099 to roughly 1291.
<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  The painting is a portable altar piece whose hinges allowed it to be closed for travel. Its owner, dressed in red, appears at the painting's left edge praying to the Virgin Mary, who holds the infant Christ. The right panel depicts Christ's crucifixion. Christ's crucified body with it heavy white highlights is influenced by contemporary Italian painting. But the enthroned Virgin and Child are shown in a majestic frontal pose typical of the Eastern Christian or Byzantine style. Meanwhile, the figures' haloes are made with the raised pattern technique seen in other artwork from the City of Accra, today, Akko Israel, then the capital of the Latin Kingdom.
Christina Nielsen:  And Accra was itself a very cosmopolitan town. Not only were there people native to Palestine, both Muslims and Eastern Christians, but also people who came as part of the Crusade and also pilgrims from Europe. So they were English, they were French, they were Italians, they were Germans. Just this great polyglot mix of people, of religious practice, and also of artistic styles, which is really beautifully encapsulated in this portable diptych.

Corpus of Christ from the Altarpiece of the Crucifixion,771.mp3,"""<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  This carved image of Christ crucified dates from around 1390. Christina Nielsen, Assistant Curator for Medieval Art.
Christina Nielsen:  The piece is relatively small in size, yet very monumental in its effect. The pain and agony that Christ suffered during crucifixion is dramatically emphasized here with the taut musculature, Christ's distended stomach, the legs which bow out but also curve in at the knee, and you see the very ripply muscles both on his abdomen but particularly in his upturned forearms. And his head is clearly drooping to one side and he is dying if not already dead. And this heightened emphasis on the suffering of Christ encouraged devout Christians to think of themselves in imitation of Christ when they also suffered pain or physical anguish.
<audio clip ends>
Narrator:  The figure was made by a celebrated medieval artist, Jacques de Baerze, for the Duke of Burgundy who then controlled the low countries and large parts of Eastern France. It was once surrounded by other carved figures as the central focus of a large altarpiece. The figures were originally painted to make them appear more lifelike. You can still see white on Christ's stomach and arms and gold on his loincloth.
Christina Nielsen:  If you imagine the altar panels being viewed under candlelight with painted sculpture, it would have almost had the effect of the works being alive."""
The Annunciation,772.mp3,"""Narrator:  One of the key moments in the Christian story is pictured here, the Angel Gabriel's announcement to the Virgin Mary that she will bear the son of God. Curator Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  We see the Virgin Mary kneeling at a prayer desk, and the Angel Gabriel floating in from the left in a rather elegant room, and we see also the dove of the Holy Ghost descending on her. And one thing that's very interesting about the picture is that the Angel Gabriel and the Virgin don't quite engage each other the way you would expect in this story. The open gesture of her hands indicates her response, but her gaze isn't directed at Gabriel himself.
Narrator:  Mary looks off to the left side of the painting where a glimpse of an outside wall and patch of grass suggest that there was once more to it than we see now. In fact, the painting was once part of a long, horizontal altarpiece painted around 1490 by the artist Jean Hey, probably for a member of the French royal family. The room in which this scene is set gives us a fascinating insight into how a lady's private chamber would have looked at the time. To hear more, press the green play button."""
Reliquary with Tooth of Saint John the Baptist,773.mp3,"""Narrator:  Christina Nielsen, Assistant Curator for Medieval Art.
Christina Nielsen:  This is a reliquary that contains the tooth of St. John the Baptist.
<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  The reliquary was made around 1400 and formed part of the treasury of an important Catholic church in Braunschweig, Germany.
Christina Nielsen:  This perfectly complete charming Gothic edifice with two buttresses and then a chapel surmounted by a Christ on top was worked by a Saxon metalworker in Germany. But that central carved rock crystal flask was carved in Egypt around the year 1000, so by the time it made its way to Germany, it would have been considered exotic and precious.
Narrator:  The crystal flask contains the relic wrapped in brown linen, then believed to be the tooth of St. John the Baptist.
Christina Nielsen:  The clergy who might have commissioned this piece would have seen that as appropriate and almost in a way as Christianity wrapping itself around Islam is appropriating this piece from the Islamic world and turning it into a prototypical Christian work of art. So taking the power of another religion and harnessing it for Christianity.

Upper Part of a Tabernacle for the Holy Sacrament,774.mp3,"""<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  Over the little doorway in the center of this Renaissance sculpture is a carved chalice with a circle above it. These represent the wafer and wine that in Catholic doctrine become the body and blood of Christ during the celebration of Mass. This piece of sculpture was a tabernacle intended to hold consecrated wine and wafers that were not used during a Mass. The tabernacle was made around 1460 by a sculptor named Isaia da Pisa for an important church in Rome. Isaia da Pisa surrounded the tabernacle doorway with an array of beautifully carved angels who guard and venerate the sacred objects within it. Notice how the central angels are carved in low relief while the two at either end are almost sculpted in the round, echoing and enhancing the gentle concave curve of the tabernacles overall form. The outer angels' intricately folded drapery and many feathered wings are especially finely carved.

Saint George Killing the Dragon,775.mp3,"""Narrator:  This painting, once the center of a large altarpiece, was made in Barcelona, Spain in the early 15th century.
<audio clip begins>
Narrator:  It depicts St. George who came to the aid of a town menaced by the terrible dragon he is now about to kill. Curator Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  According to the story, every day the dragon had to be placated with a victim chosen by lot, and on this day the lot fell to the princess, the daughter of the ruler of the town. And we see the princess, a lovely figure in the middle distance in a pink robe with fluffy red hair and a crown. Strewn around the foreground are the bones and relics of the dragon's victims, as well as lizards that seem to be sort of little baby offspring of the dragon that are emerging from the cave opening where the dragon lurks.
<audio clip ends>
Narrator:  In the background is the walled town whose inhabitants, including the princess's parents, crowd onto the battlements to view the dragon's dramatic end. The artist, Bernat Martorell, used an unusual technique of raised gesso or plaster for the dragon's spiny back and St. George's halo, armor and horse trappings. This gives the painting a strong, almost sculptural feel.
Martha Wolff:  It would probably have been even more vivid originally, because what now appears to us to be the black armor of St. George was actually silver, and the blackness comes from the tarnishing that's taken place over time with the silver."""
Wine Cistern ,776.mp3,"""Narrator:  This magnificent wine cistern or cooler was made in Italy in the mid-16th century. It would have been filled with ice and bottles during banquets. The cistern is an elaborate and splendid example of majolica or Italian tin glazed earthenware pottery. Its exterior design, based on a celebrated Renaissance mural in the Vatican, shows a Roman battle. The interior of the cistern, meanwhile, is a witty pun on its function. It shows an epic naval disaster in which Juno, queen of the gods in Roman mythology, sunk the Trojan fleet aiming to prevent Trojan hero Aeneas form reaching Rome. So as the ice inside the wine cooler melted around the wine bottles, you would look through it to see the sinking Trojan fleet, how underwater. Notice the patterns running around the rim and foot of the cistern. These were inspired by classical decoration. So the cistern is a good example of the way in which Renaissance artists and designers turn back to antique art for inspiration but then create something totally new from it."""
Gian Lodovico Madruzzo,778.mp3,"""<audio clip>
Narrator:  The Northern Italian artist Moroni painted this splendid portrait in about 1552. It emphasizes the high status of a young Italian nobleman, Gian Lodovico Madruzzo. Curator Martha Wolff.
Martha Wolff:  He's shown in a rich interior with a dramatically patterned tile floor and a wonderfully articulated marble background and a draped green velvet cloth which set off the scale of his figure wonderfully. The patterning of columns in the marble background both suggests a kind of palace setting, and it also serves to isolate the head of the sitter in a wonderful and powerful way.
Narrator:  Gian Lodovico's family were leading figures in the Counter Reformation movement, an effort to reform and reinvigorate the Catholic church in response to the challenge of the Protestant Reformation. He himself would later become Prince Bishop of Trent in Northern Italy. When this portrait was painted, he was only 20 years-old. 
Martha Wolff:  It's fascinating to think that this is such a young man who's being presented in this role of authority with his standing figure, the commanding gesture of the hand that seems to control the large hunting dog, the elegant gloves that he holds in the other hand, and his long, elegant somber clerical robes."""
The Annunciation,779.mp3,"""Narrator:  In this late 16th century bronze panel, the Virgin Mary turns, startled by the appearance of the Angel Gabriel. He points to heaven, telling Mary that she will bear God's son, as cherubs part the clouds to allow the dove of the Holy Spirit to descend upon her. The panel was made in Venice by the sculptor Alessandro Vittoria. He based his composition on a painting of the Annunciation by the great Venetian artist Titian. Vittoria modeled the scene in wax then cast it in bronze. The soft, malleable wax enabled him to create a wonderfully animated surface whose real play of light and shadow could not exist in a painting. The folds of the figures' clothing and the clouds above swirl and billow, expressing the drama and emotion of the moment. Notice also how Mary and Gabriel's upper bodies are sculpted almost in the round, giving them a great sense of liveliness and movement."""
Tarquin and Lucretia,780.mp3,"""Narrator: The great Venetian artist Tintoretto painted this dramatic scene around 1580. It tells the story of Lucretia who virtuously resisted the advances of Tarquin, son if the last king of Rome. Curator Martha Wolf:
Martha Wolf: Lucretia was forced to submit to Tarquin and she was so humiliated and distressed that as a consequence she told her husband what had happened and then she took a dagger and killed herself in order to preserve the virtue of her family. The intertwined figures of Tarquin and Lucretia really sort of encapsulate the whole story, because what we see is not only Tarquin’s attack and Lucretia’s resistance, but we also seem to see her submission at the same time. The violence of the scene is wonderfully expressed in the way Tintoretto has composed it. We see her necklace is broken and the chain of pearls is falling almost in suspended animation down from her figure. And then this richly draped bed, which is actually composed of posts made out of four nude figures, probably intended to be in bronze-- one of the figures is toppling down. 
Narrator: Tintoretto also hints at the stories tragic ending. A dagger at Lucretia’s feet maybe the one with which she will later take her life."""
A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884,781.mp3,"""Narrator: Georges Seurat’s painting of Parisians enjoying a leisurely afternoon on La Grande Jatte, an island in the River Seine, is one of the Art Institute’s most popular works. Curator Gloria Groom [ph?]:
Gloria Groom: I love it because it has this static quality as if everything is stopped and frozen and yet there’s this little girl sort of running off to the side. We see her right behind the gentleman with his lady friend in the right-hand portion of the painting. And I think that just adds such a sense of joyfulness and she is echoed by this little pug kind of dog in the foreground of the painting, who’s the other animated entity in the composition.
Narrator: The painting made in the 1880s shows the wide variety of people who might spend leisure time in a modern, suburban park. Well-dressed bourgeois citizens with top hats and parasols share the space with working people. These include the pair of soldiers in the middle distance on the bank and an off-duty nurse maid who sits with her back to us, the orange ribbon from her white cap hanging down her back.
Narrator: Seurat’s depiction of such a social mixture was not the picture’s only radical element. His way of painting this monumental canvas represented something completely new. If you’d like to hear more press the green “Play” button and let’s take a closer look."""
Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg),782.mp3,"""Narrator: Renoir painted these two young acrobats at a popular Parisian circus in 1879. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: The younger sister stands holding the oranges, which the appreciative audience is throwing to the girls after their performance, and the older sister is gesturing to the crowd. In fact, they look more like dancers having _______ finished performance rather than acrobats and this emphasis on the grace with which they hold themselves rather than on the contortions of their performance as acrobats is typical of the way Renoir approached his subject when making a painting. He was interested in conveying a sense of beauty and harmony in the picture.
Narrator: Renoir’s scene is not illuminated by the harsh gaslight that was then used in circuses--
Douglas Druick: Rather we see these two young girls depicted as if they are out of doors with a very gentle light, which draws attention to the golden details of their costume and their hair ribbons and their boots so that we get a chromatic harmony and great delicacy.
Narrator: Renoir’s close-up view of the acrobats is that of an audience member with opera glasses, such as the well-dressed man to the upper right.
Douglas Druick: And, so, this is the type of subject, which in the late 1870s when Renoir made this represented the quintessence of modern fashionable life in Paris."""
Earthly Paradise,783.mp3,"""Gloria Groom: This is an extraordinary piece. It’s very unusual. It’s a hybrid. It’s at the same time a cabinet, a piece of furniture; it’s also a wood carving and it’s also a painting since the carving is painted. 
Narrator: Curator Gloria Groom. The cabinet was made in 1888 as a collaboration between two artists, Paul Gauguin and his friend Emile Bernard.
Gloria Groom: They took on the subjects of the people, animals, and the place where they were together that summer in Pont-Aven on the Brittany coast in France. And, so, you see these women with these odd headdresses. You see oxen, you see geese. These are the sort of folklore of the town they were in. 
Narrator: Gauguin carved the central panel, which depicts the Biblical story of Jacob wrestling with an angel. The right-hand panel, also by Gaugin, includes a woman with a turban and a man in a striped shirt and straw hat. 
Gloria Groom: And these are memory people. These are figures that he drew from his last voyage to Martinique, an Island that was owned by France. And, so, it’s a wonderful blend of Gauguin’s present life of a recent trip he took, but it’s also a glimpse into Gauguin’s future for, indeed, three years after making this cabinet he would embark on another voyage this time much further away to Tahiti."""
Madame Cézanne in a Yellow Chair,785.mp3,"""Narrator: Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom: This is Madame Cézanne. It was the artist’s former model whom he married, 1886. They had one child and she was really his favorite model, maybe because Cézanne was so reclusive and he didn’t make friends easily, that he chose his wife, the easiest person he could find in his household to paint again and again and again. And what’s wonderful about these portraits is that they’re always sort of enigmatic, but at the same time object-like. She really takes the place of his beloved apples that he showed again and again in still lifes. And he shows her almost as geometric shapes that are connected in some way, but without any real personality. I mean, here’s a woman with whom he’s lived for years and years and yet she has a mask and her eyes are little slits and there’s no way we can find out what she’s all about or communicate with her, because that’s not what he’s interested in. He’s looking at her as a series of formal shapes and contours. And, yet, she also has this wonderful roundedness to her. She’s a series of ovals until you get to her fingers, which are sort of squid-like and writhing and they’re agitated and they’re nervous, in complete contra-distinction to the placidness of her expression. It’s like all her energy is seeping down into her fingers as they clinch each other."""
The Bedroom,786.mp3,"""Narrator: Vincent Van Gogh moved to Arles from Paris in early 1888. 
Douglas Druick: What we see here is Vincent Van Gogh’s depiction of the bedroom in the house that he rented in Arles in the south of France.
Narrator: Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: What you also see are paintings by Vincent hanging on the walls. And these paintings speak to an ambition that Vincent had and that was to make of this little house that he had rented a gathering point for young artists like himself who were trying to throw off the shackles of traditional painting and pioneer a new art. Van Gogh set about painting works of art as he said, “To make the house a real artist’s house.”
Narrator: One of the artists Van Gogh invited was Paul Gauguin. 
Douglas Druick: When Gauguin arrived in Arles “The Bedroom” was one of the pictures that he admired most and because Van Gogh so admired Gauguin he was very gratified. Vincent’s idea was that “The Bedroom” would convey a sense of absolute quiet, rest, and repose. In fact, the picture was somewhat agitated. Look at the way the floor rushes back and up into the picture space. Indeed, we know that the room wasn’t rectangular in shape, that one of the walls was on a slant. But, nonetheless, with this racing perspective and with this contrast between large and small with the foot and the head of the bed one gets a sense of almost vertiginous space."""
Day (Truth),787.mp3,"""Gloria Groom: This is a really shocking painting to come upon after seeing the French Impressionists. Suddenly, you’re confronted with a life-size figure of a woman totally naked with her arms outstretched and this hypnotic stare that just holds you.
Narrator: Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom: It’s about a nude being used as a symbol by an artist who was known as the symbolist art [ph?] salon’s Ferdinand Hodler, a Swiss artist who really became known in Paris for these types of paintings that were about ideas and emotions. 
Narrator: Hodler called the painting “Day” or “Truth”.
Gloria Groom: Either one could be symbolized by this painting. She could be perhaps pushing away the clouds of darkness and coming into the light or she could be pushing away the clouds of deceit and showing that she has nothing to hide, that this is truth, that this is truth laid bare, as it were.
Narrator: Notice how the strange dream-like landscape is made up of thinly painted veils of color while the woman’s body is more thickly painted, giving it a greater sense of volume and solidity.
Gloria Groom: It’s very beautifully painted in an almost classical manner, almost an old master of layering on layering of pigments. And yet her hair is very graphic. It’s almost like poster art. It’s black and green, it’s striated, and it has those under-lighting forms that you find in Art Nouveau, design at the time, and this is right in the middle of the Art Nouveau movement."""
At the Moulin Rouge,788.mp3,"""Q: Toulouse Lautrec made his name with his depictions of the night clubs and performers of Montmartre in northern Paris. Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom: So, he’s really documenting not only the night club, but this phenomena that happens at the end of the 19th century in France, which is celebrity culture. Probably the most well-known of these performers is Jane Avril. She’s the woman you see with her back turned to us, this incredibly orange-red hair. 
Narrator: Jane Avril is seated with friends at the table that was permanently reserved for Toulouse Lautrec at the Moulin Rouge. Curiously, the artist depicts himself walking by behind the table. He’s the very short man walking with a much taller figure.
Gloria Groom: And then the other performer that was well-known at the time is this very garish-looking woman who just looms out into our space at the right-hand side of the canvas and she is an English performer named May Milton with this kind of insect-like hat that he would always portray her in.
Narrator: The heavy greenish shadows on her face exaggerate the effects of the recently installed electric lighting. They give her face and eerie mask-like character, which is both compelling and chilling.
Gloria Groom: He really is capturing not just who was who and who was where, but it’s the sense of decadence. It’s the sense of sleaziness. It’s the sense of people out into the wee hours of the night drinking and just carrying on. And that energy is very much expressed in this painting especially."""
"Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn)",789.mp3,"""Narrator: Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom: This painting of the stacks of wheat was done when Monet was already in his sixties and it really represents the beginning of a whole new chapter in his career where he’s not just painting landscapes, but he’s really thinking about the motif, the subject and how it can be part of a total ensemble so that he’s working in what they called series, which seems like a simple idea, but at the time no artist had really taken on one subject, seen at different times of day, different seasons. And he didn’t work on them all at the same time. He might work on one, two or three canvasses, but the real work took place back in the studio where he could compare the effects that he was trying to get, the effects of sunset, for example, or the effects of snow or the early frost. And then he would work on them looking at them all together till he got them to a place where he felt, “Okay, now they’re finished,” and then he showed them together. So, we have six of the fifteen that he exhibited in 1891, which is extraordinary, and as you can see in this one, which is the effect of snow, there’s no white in this painting per se. The snow is rendered in this kind of blueish-pink, because that was the effect rather than the description he was searching for."""
"Houses of Parliament, London",790.mp3,"""Narrator: Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom: Although at the end of life, Monet spent most of his time in Giverny painting the hillsides and the famous water lily pond, he did take trips away. And one of the trips he continued to take, starting in 1900, was to London. 
Narrator: There Monet developed a series of paintings based on the River Thames. This one depicts the Houses of Parliament veiled in fog. 
Gloria Groom: And he loved London’s atmosphere, because, well, when he went during the winter months it was normally gray and chilly and had moisture in the air and he loved the fog. He loved this idea of this grayness, this heaviness, and he’s working with a building that represents the government, the Houses of Parliament. And yet he’s dissolving it just like he would dissolve nature, that atmospheric effect that changes whatever it is permeating.
Narrator: Monet’s soft brush strokes and rich blue-purple colors transform the venerable neo-gothic buildings. The towers and pentacles silhouetted against the fiery tones of the setting sun seem dramatically lengthened by the soft light filtering through the foggy haze giving them a sense of poetry and mystery."""
Landscape: Window Overlooking the Woods,791.mp3,"""Narrator: This expansive, verdant landscape was painted by the French artist Édouard Vuillard in 1899. It was one of a pair of paintings intended to decorate the interior of a Parisian apartment. The owner, Vuillard’s patron, also collected old tapestries. Curator Gloria Groom.
Gloria Groom: And I think this painting very much fits into that aesthetic of tapestry. It has a kind of woven quality. It’s made with zones of color, big broad horizontal bands. He’s also adding this garland on three of the sides so that you sense a kind of a swag effect like this is tapestry, this is a fabric that is hanging down and has a kind of a give to it. But then he’s done something very clever at the bottom and the painting is called “Window Overlooking the Woods”. He’s created a kind of a faux windowsill. It’s as if you’re looking out on the undulating hills that go right up to the top where there’s just a little band of the horizon. 
Narrator: Vuillard based his decorative arrangement of abstract pattern forms on a landscape he knew well: the valley outside Paris where his sister lived.
Gloria Groom: And he’s painting as if he’s looking out the window, maybe even from her house, or looking onto her. There’s a woman in the window, framed by the window with red geraniums, and the geraniums catch your eye on the left-hand side of the painting. And you wonder is that his sister? Who is that? Does he know her? It’s kind of an intimist’s view on this grand panoramic scale."""
Paris Street; Rainy Day,792.mp3,"""Narrator: The Impressionist artist Gustave Caillebotte painted this picture in 1877. Curator Gloria Groom.
G: This is a wonderful view of modern life in Paris with this radiating intersection and these new boulevards that had just been constructed right around the neighborhood that Caillebotte lived in all his life. His family home was just a couple of blocks away. It’s an amazing slice of life and slice is really the word you use because he’s cropped the figures at the side. It has this sense of immediacy that makes it totally characteristic of Impressionism, which was about that transitory, that momentary, and the painting of modern life, which it certainly is.
Narrator: For instance, notice the fashionable new retractable umbrellas. But despite this interest in the momentary and modern, Caillebotte’s approach also contains more traditional elements. He made numerous preparatory studies for this work whose scale is comparable to a grand history painting. 
G: Caillebotte was different from his Impressionist friends who mostly sketched with a much more open brushwork. His were firmly model forms and, yet, even though it’s a much more readable way of depicting the scene the cobblestones that he shows us in the left foreground are so incredibly painterly that when you look at them you forget what they’re trying to describe and you see them as these abstract shapes.

Le Grenouillard (Frog-Man),793.mp3,"""Narrator: The French sculptor Jean-Joseph Carriès made this unusual piece called the “Le Grenouillard”, or “The Frogman”, in 1892. It was included in his exhibition in Paris that year, which caused a sensation among avant-garde artists and critics. Darwin’s theory of evolution had become popularized in the late 19th century and artists like Carriès created figures that seemed to reach across from the animal world to the human world. “The Frogman” is a rather grotesque figure who resembles the frogs that he is clutching or seated on his back and around his feet. He has a long spine, bulging eyes and even webbed frog-like feet. Carriès, like many of his contemporaries, was also very interested in Japanese art which enjoyed a great vogue in France, beginning in the 1860s. This piece is reminiscent of Japanese netsuke or small, decorative carvings often prized for the wit and humor of their subject matter. Carriès sculpture is made of plaster, but its polished, colored surface calls to mind the deep shine of bronzes and Japanese lacquers."""
The Millinery Shop,795.mp3,"""Narrator: Edgar Degas was fascinated by Parisian millinery shops with their lavish displays of colorful hats and their elegant shop girls and customers. This young woman who’s inspecting a hat at arm’s length might possibly be a client, but it’s perhaps more likely a shop assistant. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: If indeed the young woman is a milliner working her craft, the hat that she’s working on seems not to have been finished. The whole question of finished and unfinished-- in other words, when the picture was completed-- was something that was very close to Degas’ practice and even in this picture some of the other hats that are on the stands seem less finished than the blue hat and the pink hat with the gold ribbon and that wonderful hat with green ribbon. What’s also interesting though in terms of the ambiguity in this picture is Degas identification with the whole milliner theme, because Degas was born into an affluent banking family. However, as an artist he, like the milliners, spent his time creating things with his hands and using materials. And I think that this picture is, in a way, a metaphor for many of the issues that Degas was confronting himself as an artist."""
"The Ancestors of Tehamana, or Tehamana Has Many Parents (Merahi metua no Tehamana)",796.mp3,"""Narrator: Paul Gauguin painted this young Tahitian woman in 1893. He had left Paris for the South Pacific two years earlier in search of what he called a primitive past. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: He had hoped that he would see and learn about aspects of Tahitian myth, Tahitian religion, and that he would see wonderful artefacts that were made before Tahiti had been colonized. In fact, he found that the French influence was so pervasive that Papeete, the capital of Tahiti, seemed totally French.
Narrator: This painting depicts Gauguin’s Tahitian companion Tehamana. She wears a modest dress of the kind provided by Catholic missionaries. But the fragrant flowers in her hair signal the very sensuality that the dress was intended to obscure. 
Douglas Druick: And what he also introduces into the picture is a sense of what the Tahitian past might have been. The title is “The Ancestors of Tehamana” and the ancestors are the figures in the frieze that we see behind the figure of Tehamana, which represent the two founding gods of the Tahitian culture from which it was assumed that all Tahitians like Tehamana descended. He also invents the writing which appears above Tehamana’s head. These were taken from tablets from Easter Island that had been shown in the international exhibition in Paris in 1889. He had travelled to find the authentic Tahiti. In the absence of finding it he had to invent it and this is a portrait of that invention."""
In the Sea,797.mp3,"""Douglas Druick: What we see before us is a scene of consummate strangeness.
Narrator: The painting was made in 1883 by the Swiss artist Arnold Böcklin. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: The scene is populated by strange and somewhat grotesque sea creatures, half man and half fish, mermaids and mermen. They seem to be engaged in a concert. The merman has this rather primitive lyre that he’s playing on and his mouth is open in song. So, too, are the mouths of the mermaids who surround him. We know that the artist wanted the viewer to have a strong sense of sound, raucous sound shattering the crystalline calm of the sea that the creatures are playing in. The figure of the merman has been associated with the features of the artist himself.
Narrator: Indeed, his lyre features Böcklin’s initials. Just as these strange creatures shatter the calm of their environment, Böcklin intended to use his art to break out of the dominant artistic style of his time, which was French Impressionism. 
Douglas Druick: What he was trying to achieve was something different and it relied more on the imagination, painting coming from the imagination, from poetry, from myths of the past, and even from music. This is a world like ours but totally different from ours. And, so, it challenges us with its strangeness because it’s familiar in some ways and totally different in others."""
The Girl by the Window,798.mp3,"""Narrator: In a darkened room represented with deep melancholy blues a young woman looks out her window into the night. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: What Munch has done with this subject is to create an atmosphere of mystery and even foreboding. Notice how the woman is looking at the window. She’s drawing aside the curtain so that she can see outside, but yet she also seems to be hiding her face with the curtain so that anyone looking from the outside won’t see her. It raises questions in the viewer about why she is behaving as she is, whom is she looking at, whom is she perhaps afraid to be seen by? There’s an indication at the lower right that we’re seeing a round table, but what is happening to the young woman’s right? There’s a pit of blackness and one can almost read forms. So, it’s like reading clouds. One can almost imagine figures or forms there, but one’s not sure if they’re there or whether they’re the project [sic] of the imagination of the viewer who’s looking at them. What Munch is hinting at is the inner life of this young woman so that we’re introduced to this figure, become involved in her story, and yet our desires for a clear narrative are thwarted."""
Bathers by a River,801.mp3,"""Narrator: Henri Matisse began this monumental scene in 1909 as an image of bathers by a stream painted in pastel colors. Over the next eight years he radically transformed the painting. Its changes reflect important influences on Matisse during this period. The strong colors and powerful light of Morocco, the new geometric imagery of Cubism, and the terrible darkness of World War I. Stephanie D'Alessandro, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern Art.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: So, we see a picture in the end here that by 1917 becomes very abstract. We see these beautiful geometric bands, these figures pressed against them. It becomes a much more restricted kind of canvas with these grayer colors, more somber colors in certain ways. We see a process of experimentation in this picture that is purely Matisse. We see him loading his brush in certain areas and slathering on this paint in beautiful areas. If you look at the third figure from the left, just behind the knee you can see this beautiful white paint that just seems to be plopped right onto the surface. Matisse is playing with paint almost like clay. 
Narrator: Matisse believed this to be one of the five most pivotal works of his career. 
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Matisse approached it in a very physical way and I think that’s part of the reason why he thought it was such a pivotal work for him and he used it to experiment on many different ideas before he brought them to other works.

Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz,803.mp3,"""Narrator: Amedeo Modigliani painted this double portrait in 1916. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: Modigliani was born and trained in Italy and came to Paris in 1906. Paris, of course, then being the artistic center of vanguard painting.
Narrator: Modigliani lived in the Bohemian Montparnasse quarter where many young artists congregated. 
Douglas Druick: They saw each other socially and worked together and became known as the so-called “School of Paris”. Many of the artists in the School of Paris shared the fact that they were born outside of France and they also many of them shared the fact that they had a Jewish ancestry and that includes both Modigliani, the painter of this portrait, and Jacques Lipchitz, the sculptor. He’s portrayed here with his recent bride, a Russian poet by the name of Berthe Kitrosser. 
Narrator: Modigliani painted the portrait in his hallmark style flattening the forms of his sitters’ faces and depicting their features with sharp sinuous lines that recall those of carved wooden masks.
Douglas Druick: This is one of only two double portraits that Modigliani painted. I think it gives us some insight into the couple that he is portraying. For example, Berthe looks to us as a more open, inviting, friendly personality. Lipchitz, himself, faces out towards us, but the expression is much more veiled.

Champs de Mars: The Red Tower,804.mp3,"""Stephanie D'Alessandro: Robert Delaunay’s “Red Tower” isn’t a red tower at all. It’s the Eiffel Tower in Paris and for many, many years, and I think even still today, it’s a great icon of modernity. The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 for the Paris World’s Fair and it was the tallest building in the world until the 1930s-- until 1930.
Narrator: Stephanie D'Alessandro, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern Art.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Delaunay was an artist who was very inspired by Cubism, the idea of looking for geometric shapes in many ways to help describe things in the natural world in a more systematic and regular kind of way. But at the same time he was interested in fracturing forms and dissolving these kinds of solids. I think one thing that’s amazing about this picture is the way that the Eiffel Tower seems to be busting through the surface of this picture. It’s so powerful and dynamic and I think Delaunay in many ways accentuates that with these beautiful rays of light that are fractured and shining through the spaces of the tower. And look up on the right-hand side, how amazing it seems, almost like they’re wings-- like the building is going to almost fly right out of this urban space. It’s a wonderful celebration of modernity in so many ways.

Painting with Green Center,805.mp3,"""Narrator: Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky made this painting in 1913 while living in Germany. Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Kandinsky really wanted to push painting into a realm that hadn’t been explored and that meant abstraction. It meant looking for new ways of moving towards that kind of immaterial sort of form that music has. And, so, he looked at the materials that he would use traditionally for paintings, colors, forms, composition, and tried to find equivalences in reality. The color yellow, a color that’s very prominent in this picture, would for Kandinsky suggest the taste of lemons or the sound of bells. And blue was a kind of heavenly color or restful color that could bring a balance to a picture. 
Narrator: Kandinsky’s unconventional ideas about orchestrating color and emotion were an important contribution to a new movement called Expressionism. The Expressionists often used bold colors and distorted forms to heighten feeling in their compositions. 
Stephanie D'Alessandro: This effort toward getting at a soul-stirring kind of experience is part of what Expressionism was in Germany at the turn of the century. Artists began to look for new ways to get at a more sincere emotional, psychological kind of connection with viewers.

Interrelation of Volumes from the Ellipsoid,807.mp3,"""Narrator: This plaster sculpture made in 1926 by the Belgian artist Georges Vantongerloo is based on his belief in the eternal beauty of geometric forms. Curator Stephanie D'Alessandro.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: It may initially seem like a very strict, very static, very abstract and almost impersonal kind of work, something that is very much based on math or science or perfect proportion. But the hand of the artist is very much there. There’s a sense of invention. You can see the way that he put these forms together. After World War War I artists looked back on the work that they had made and found out many of the forms that they had chosen to use in the past, painting in a representational style, let’s say, didn’t have the same meaning after the war. And they began to search for new forms. In particular, artists looked to art to heal society and some of the works that we’re looking at in this gallery have to do with that effort.
Narrator: Vantongerloo and other artists associated with the Dutch artist movement known as De Stijl, or “the style”, believed in the universal language of abstraction.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: One of the most important factors of the style was a true non-representational kind of form looking to geometric shapes and pure line as a kind of static peaceful kind of blank slate in a way and pure color-- the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue and the additional colors of white and black and gray.

Reclining Nude,808.mp3,"""Narrator: The German artist Max Beckmann painted this reclining nude in Paris in 1929. Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern Art Stephanie D'Alessandro.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Beckmann was associated with a style known as “New Objectivity” and it came as a kind of reaction from World War I, the idea of looking at society in a kind of biting way, painting in a more realistic style that I think a picture like this beautiful reclining nude demonstrates some of that style of New Objectivity, Beckmann seems to be exploring her in a scientific way. What’s amazing about this picture is also the way that Beckmann paints it. There’s a real love of material, the way that heavy paint falls on the thigh, for example, where you can see it pooled up on just above her knee and I think some of his great love of paint and his enjoyment of painting really comes from his time that he spends in Paris looking at artists who he may have rebuffed earlier, especially Matisse, who he sees as a kind of rival. He allows himself to find the pleasure that other artists in Paris would at this time with pure painting, enjoying experimenting with what paint can do on a surface.

Mother and Child,809.mp3,"""Narrator: Art Institute director Douglas Druick.
Douglas Druick: This picture of a mother and her child at the beach was painted by Pablo Picasso in 1921, the same year that his first son was born by his wife, Olga Khokhlova, who had been a dancer with the Ballet Russe. 
Narrator: After the cataclysmic events of World War I many artists including Picasso looked back to classical sources in their search and integrity. 
Douglas Druick: We know that Picasso goes to Rome in 1917 and is very deeply affected by the Roman sculpture that he sees while he’s in the city. This classical vocabulary enters his work and it’s fully expressed in this picture of 1921 in which you have this great solid monumental figure of the woman with the child in her lap. One thinks in terms of the volumes of important antique sculpture which have this sense of weight and monumentality and, indeed, serenity. The fascinating thing about Picasso is that he could explore different styles simultaneously.
Narrator: Turn around to look at the figure in a red armchair across the gallery. This painting made ten years after the mother and child depicts Marie Thérèse Walter, with whom Picasso had recently become involved.
Douglas Druick: This is the first picture in which Picasso used what will become a signature iconography and that is painting a figure face-on and in profile and melding the two together as he does in this portrait of Marie Thérèse.

This classical vocabulary enters his work and it’s fully expressed in this picture of 1921 in which you have this great solid monumental figure of the woman with the child in her lap. One thinks in terms of the volumes of important antique sculpture which have this sense of weight and monumentality and, indeed, serenity. The fascinating thing about Picasso is that he could explore different styles simultaneously.
Narrator: Turn around to look at the figure in a red armchair across the gallery. This painting made ten years after the mother and child depicts Marie Thérèse Walter, with whom Picasso had recently become involved.
Douglas Druick: This is the first picture in which Picasso used what will become a signature iconography and that is painting a figure face-on and in profile and melding the two together as he does in this portrait of Marie Thérèse. The picture is not only inventive, formally, pictorially, it’s also very inventive in terms of the materials that Picasso used.

Reclining Woman,810.mp3,"""Narrator: Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago. 
Douglas Druick: This picture of a reclining woman by Fernand Léger speaks to what is often referred to as “the return to order” in French painting in the years following the First World War. Traumatized by the cataclysm that was World War I many of the artists, reflecting the people in French society, desired a return to more enduring values. It’s expressed by Léger in this picture by the way he balances the composition, horizontals and verticals, creating a stable visual field, but even more importantly by the subject.
Narrator: The female nude is a traditional subject in the history of art, reaching back through the Renaissance to antiquity. 
Douglas Druick: But what he has done is he’s taken a traditional subject, a classical subject if you wish, and he has modernized it because he has seen the figure through the lens of contemporary life and notably the technological advances that were part of contemporary society. The figure is composed of component parts which suggest even machine parts. For Léger modern life and the new industrial age in which he was living were a promise for a better future.

White Crucifixion,811.mp3,"""Narrator: Curator Stephanie D'Alessandro.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Marc Chagall’s an artist who we normally think of with these very beautiful, lyrical, dream-like pictures often with men and women and animals floating in space, very joyful images. However, in the 1930s he began to focus more directly on the political and social situations that were happening in Europe and most particularly on the persecution of the Jews. 
Narrator: In this painting made in 1938 Chagall focuses on one of the most resonant persecutions in Western culture, the crucifixion of Christ. Radically, he emphasizes Christ’s Jewish identity, linking his suffering with that of contemporary Jewish people. Christ’s loincloth is a Jewish prayer shawl and Biblical patriarchs and a matriarch float above him in place of angels. 
Stephanie D'Alessandro: There are a number of smaller scenes in the picture that relate some of the recent events that happened in Europe at about this time including Kristallnacht, which was on the ninth of November in 1938 when in Germany the Jewish synagogues were ransacked and burned. Even though this picture isn’t as colorful as Chagall’s typical images, there’s actually a very beautiful quality of light in this painting. There’s a black and white contrast that Chagall used to evoke a sense of ethereality and spiritualism even in a picture that has such sad imagery.
Narrator: In 1937 Chagall wrote an autobiographical poem that reflects many of the images seen in this painting. To hear and excerpt press the “Play” button now."""
Golden Bird,812.mp3,"""Narrator: “All my life I have sought to render the essence of flight.” These are the words of Constantin Brâncusi who started work on this abstract work titled “Golden Bird” in 1919. Brâncusi, who was Romanian by birth, lived and worked for most of his career in Paris where he developed a new approach to making sculpture, simplifying forms until he had paired them down to the pure expression of his subjects’ essential character. The “Golden Bird”’s elegant golden lines reach upward evoking the silhouette of a bird lifting its beak to the sky and the gleaming bronze with its almost fluid reflections suggest the speed of flight. It contrasts with the more Earth-bound stone and wood of the base elements. Stephanie D'Alessandro, Curator of Modern Art.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Brâncusi was constantly combining and re-combining almost on a daily basis the component parts of his sculptures and also focusing not just on that whole work, but on the relationship of that work to the others in the space. A visitor to his studio would come one day and see a sculpture looking a certain way and come the next day and find parts of it re-combined on another piece. We’re standing in a gallery that features three of the great Brâncusis in the Art Institute’s collection. And, so, for us, these works seem to have their most perfect home in this space where they have now another communication, another relationship with the light and space just outside the museum with Millennium Park and the life of the street.

Forest and Sun,813.mp3,"""Narrator: This work is called “Forest and Sun”, massive closely grouped trees emerge from the darkness in the center of the painting. They are split by the perfect circular form of the sun. This painting is by Max Ernst, a World War I veteran who would become involved with the Dada movement in the 1920s. The Dadaists question fundamental aspects of art-making. Their revolutionary ideas later became part of the foundation of the surrealist of which this and other works in this gallery relating to the unconscious and to chance are apart. Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Ernst was very interested in the unconscious and part of his way of getting to that unconscious to use that sort of untrained, untapped wild creative spirit was by using techniques that came from doodling that came from automatic writing, from scribbling, from chance and spontaneity. Ernst would look for inspiration in many different places. Sometimes it had to do with found materials, bits of leather or sandpaper, but his techniques were also unusual. And he would find inspiration from the things around him. For example, rubbing the floorboard with paint of some kind of other material to bring the relief surface and the pattern of the floor onto the canvas as a starting kind of inspiration for the beginning of a work.

Visions of Eternity,814.mp3,"""Narrator: The Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dali finished this painting in 1937, titling it “Visions of Eternity”. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Douglas Druick: we see what looks like a remnant of a classical arch and on top of it a figure whose hands are brought together in what might be a gesture of prayer, but could also be a gesture of despair. Something has blown a whole through the figure. It’s a very barren landscape and, yet, those bean-like forms on the ground suggest the possibility of seed-like rebirth. The whole tradition of painting in Western European art treats the picture like a window onto the natural world. What Dali and the other surrealists wished to do was to take that tradition, but introduce a new dimension of reality, the reality of the inner world, the world of dreams and the imaginations and desires and psychoses. This ambition was formed by what the artists of this generation had witnessed and that is the cataclysm of the First World War when the veneer of rationalism had broken down and the violence that’s never far from the surface of civilized society had broken forth.

Time Transfixed,815.mp3,"""Douglas Druick: “Time Transfixed” is one of Belgian surrealist artist René Magritte’s great masterpieces, a startling image of a train belching smoke emerging from a fireplace.
Narrator: Art Institute director Douglas Druick.
Douglas Druick: This picture exemplifies Magritte’s surrealism, the desire to bring together an impossible conjunction of conscious and unconscious images. The title “Time Transfixed” suggests that everything has come to a halt. The world has stood still. We are looking at time, which has been frozen. What makes this picture so memorable is that it’s so utterly unexpected. And that was the kind of visual magic that Magritte could create by juxtaposing elements that are normally not juxtaposed in human experience.
Narrator: The train with its connotations of dirty smoke, billowing steam and noise is all the more startling for its appearance in such an orderly bourgeois interior. And yet it has a connection with reality in its coal-fired engine and smoky funnel, which recalled the coal-fired stoves installed in fire places. Magritte made the painting for the London house of a wealthy English patron, Edward James. It was one of three paintings intended to decorate the home’s ballroom though the collector chose another location for the work once it was completed."""
Chess Set,817.mp3,"""Narrator: Man Ray, the surrealist artist and photographer produced this chess set out of brass, silver and gold in 1926. Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: It was inspired by some of the objects in Man Ray’s studio. If you look at the knight, you see it has a kind of scroll form like a violin. He thought the form looked like a horse and, so, he used this found object in place of a more familiar one. For Man Ray chess was more than an intellectual pursuit, though he loved to play the game. It was also something artist. Man Ray often instructed his students as one of their very first lessons when they worked with him to lay out a chess board, to actually think about the chess board like a painting. Chess playing was a way to free the mind that could allow us to move in all directions. It involved chance, it involved creativity, it involved improvisation and it also involved very popular surrealist themes, those of violence and sexuality and battle.

Painting,818.mp3,"""Narrator: Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: The shapes in this painting are very similar to some of the shapes that we see in the rest of this gallery. They’re forms that are abstract and unusual. They have an organic quality to them. They come from the imagination. They almost seem to be growing.
Narrator: This painting is by the Spanish surrealist artist Joan Miró. 
Stephanie D'Alessandro: It’s a picture that in many ways is not that lyrical and not that beautiful and that was okay for Miró. This was a moment in surrealism and in Miró’s painting where he really wanted to destroy the tradition of painting. In fact, he used the word “assassinate”. He wanted to assassinate painting, meaning he wanted to start fresh and make something that came from a new place. He used the idea of automatism, meaning actions that are done automatically, just like we doodle when we’re maybe talking on the phone. Miró didn’t just look to the unconscious to be the source of a work like this, he also sought out the untraditional in terms of techniques and media. What we’re looking at is a piece of Masonite. It’s a rough man-made material and on that background he painted this image and added to oil paint gravel and dust and stones. And that rough, unexpected quality is very much what Miró was after. And how ironic then that he would call it “painting”.

Walking Man II,819.mp3,"""Narrator: Curator of modern art Stephanie D'Alessandro.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: The standing woman and walking man that you see here are as large as we are. And yet they are so thin that they seem like the could break if we touch them. The surface of these works seem like they’ve been charred, like they’ve weathered the war. 
Narrator: The figures are by Alberto Giacometti whose work influenced by surrealism was profoundly affected by his experience of World War II and the Holocaust. As the writer Simone de Beauvoir put it, “The war was over, but it remained on our hands like a great unwanted corpse and there was no place on Earth to bury it.”
Stephanie D'Alessandro: Alberto Giacometti was very interested in surrealism and participated in many exhibitions and produced many wonderful works that involve the idea of dreams and non-Western art and curious juxtapositions of things. But after World War II his art took a more serious turn. In the forties his works changed to focus on a kind of isolated figure who seemed lonely, seemed fragile, had a kind of skeletal appearance. They seem often very dark, almost made out of earth or material that was left after destruction. Many people see in Giacometti’s work this kind of fragile existence that humans faced after the destruction of World War II.

The Earth Is a Man,820.mp3,"""Narrator: The South American artist known as Matta settled in France in 1933 where he became involved with the surrealists. This painting is a tribute to his friend, the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca, who was killed by Fascist forces during the Spanish War. Curator of modern art, Stephanie D'Alessandro.
Stephanie D'Alessandro: This painting is just a marvel. It’s so intricate and mysterious and beautiful and ethereal all at the same time. Matta was very interested in trying to harness the subconscious and he came up with this idea of what he called psychological morphologies. They were basically paintings that he made using the special kind of technique of dripping paint and thin washes over the canvas and drawing out sort of unconscious, unplanned forms. So, we can see the early part of Matta’s process, these beautiful thin veils and washes of paint. For example, on the bottom part of the canvas where it almost seems like we see yellow earth or some kind of horizon line that meets this beautiful blue celestial kind of sky. You can see on top of that area these thin lines of darker paint that almost look like ink wash where he’s gone in and started to describe imaginary figures or forms to now take this image to another level, another level of description.

The Captive Slave,821.mp3,"""Narrator:  This moving portray of an enslaved man was painted in England in 1827 by John Philip Simpson. The artist conveys a powerful sense of the man’s dignity and intelligence, and unmistakable condemnation of his situation. Our attention is caught by the shackles around the man’s wrist. It is also drawn to the expression in his face which suggests profound sadness, stoically born. The man looks up as if toward a window that lets a meager amount of light into his dismal surroundings. This light falls on his face. It emphasizes his eyes and forehead, and thus his senses and intellect. In other words, his humanity. Simpson made this painting at the height of the British abolitionists’ fervent campaign to end slavery in the British empire. The painting was exhibited publicly in London where it attracted much attention. One critic declared, “It is true in all its bearings, and appeals directly to the heart.” The captive slave in Simpson’s painting may have been modeled by Ira Aldridge, a freeborn African American from New York who became a celebrated Shakespearean actor on the London stage."""
Interrupted Reading,823.mp3,"""Narrator:  Leaning gracefully against her hand and letting her book slip into her lap, this woman seems lost in thought. A solitary, contemplative woman was a popular theme among early nineteenth century romantic artists. It allowed the artists to give a sense of the subject’s intellect and imagination while also focusing on her beauty and her pose. This image is by Camille Corot, best known for his poetic landscapes. Late in his career he began to make figure paintings such as this one. The painting’s luminosity recalls the silvery light of his earlier landscapes. Here Corot restricts his palette to a narrow range of warm browns and whites set off by the woman’s dark hair and vivid red beads. Although Corot’s subject may be more traditional his technique is often breathtakingly free and modern. The highlights in folds of the woman’s skirt for instance are described with broad sweeps of paint. Corot’s bold handling of paint recalls that of his younger artist friends, the impressionists, who were transforming French art right around the same time."""
The Races at Longchamp,824.mp3,"""Narrator:  When Edouard Manet made this painting in 1866 it would have appeared radical in every way. To begin with, its subject matter is thoroughly modern. The painting depicts Longchamp racecourse frequented by well-heeled Parisians. To the far left are two fashionable ladies, one with a parasol, and the spectator stands are a mass of black top hats. Rather than painting from a conventional viewpoint among the crowds, Manet chooses a much more daring perspective. He places us right in the racetrack. We can almost hear the thundering horses as the gallop toward us past the finish line, marked by the pole with the circular disk. As part of his effort to capture this specific and thrilling moment Manet conveys movement in a variety of ways. Our sense of the horses’ speed is heightened by the dust clouds around their hooves, and by the sharply converging size of the track from which they seem to burst forth. The dashing horses and jostling crowds are described with swift, often unblended dashes of paint. This revolutionary way of painting later prompted a reviewer to judge the scene as a sketch, but in the lower right corner Manet signed and dated his canvas, signaling that he considered it a finished work."""
Still Life : Corner of a Table,825.mp3,"""Narrator:  This beautiful still life was painted by Henri Fontin-Latour in 1873. Fontin was a friend of several impressionist artists, but he chose a very different artistic path to theirs. The impressionists pursued fleeting effects of light and movement to convey a sense of the momentary, but Fontin was uncomfortable painting anything that changed more quickly than his brush could move. A strict realist, he painted only what could remain stationary, and as a result was drawn to still lifes and portraiture. Here Fontin depicts part of the dining table, its objects slightly disarranged as if just after a meal, and yet it soon becomes clear that every element of the composition was orchestrated with great care. A dark gray wall and neatly pressed white tablecloth perfectly set off the different objects. The warm glow of the fruit is juxtaposed with the cool, gleaming silver of the sugar basin and the bright touches of light on the glass objects. And in front of all these, extending up toward the arrangement on the table is a glorious mass of rhododendron flowers and leaves. They are silhouetted against a white cloth in a way that recalls the flattened decorative compositions of Japanese prints, then much collected in French artistic circles."""
"On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt",826.mp3,"""Narrator:  Claude Monet painted this picture of his future wife, Camille Doncieux sitting on a bank of the river Seine outside Paris. They were staying with their baby in the village of Bennecourt, seen across the river. Monet was then in his late twenties and not yet widely known as an artist. But he was already making highly experimental paintings with new kinds of themes taken from modern life, such as this one. Monet’s technique was also extremely radical. The painting is built up with broad, unblended brushstrokes. Contemporary viewers were used to paintings that aim to mirror reality, with a smooth traditional paint surface. To them Monet’s approach seemed shockingly unfinished and illegible. If we look closely at Camille’s skirt, for example, it is hard to tell where it ends and the grass beings. But Monet’s dynamic technique also gives the scene a feeling of spontaneity, as if he has truly captured a fleeting moment in this calm sun filled afternoon. Rectangles of brown and white in the river suggest reflections of the buildings and clouds, and on the foreground bank dashes of yellow represent flowers, fragile enough to move in the slightest breeze."""
"Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare",827.mp3,"""Narrator:  In 1877 Monet rented an apartment near the Gare Saint-Lazare, one of the great nineteenth century Paris train stations. Exhilarated by the station’s modern glass and iron architecture and its atmosphere of activity and constant change he began work on a group of paintings there. Monet called this version “Arrival of the Normandy Train,” underling his aim to represent a sense of movement in his painting. We see the great black locomotive pulling into the station. Clouds of steam issue from its funnel as it grinds to a halt against the buffers. The steam, conjured up with quick, curving dashes of paint seems heavy and gray beneath the station’s canopy, but turns white as it escapes and catches the daylight outside. A mass of people greets the train. They are described simply by strokes of dark paint, whose indistinctness gives the crowd a sense of jostling movement. For Monet, the Gare Saint-Lazare had particular significance. Down the railway line at Argenteuil lay his family’s riverside home. The Gare Sainte-Lazare marked the point where Monet entered the very different world of the city, full of urban stimulation where his clients and dealers could be found."""
Two Sisters (On the Terrace),828.mp3,"""Narrator:  This lyrical portrayal of two girls by Auguste Renoir is one of the most popular works in the Art Institute. Renoir painted it in 1881, setting it on the terrace of the restaurant Fournaise, which overlooked a modest stretch of the river Seine just outside Paris. By 1881 he had been visiting the restaurant and painting its fashionable Parisian visitors and beautiful surroundings for more than ten years. Here, Renoir depicts an elegant young woman sitting in the warm sunshine accompanied by a little girl. They are not, in fact, sisters, but unrelated models despite the painting’s title. The young woman wears a female boater’s blue flannel costume, which she has enlivened with a cherry red hat and a cluster of bright spring flowers on the bodice. These elements with the little girl’s flower laden hat and their basket of wool lend the image an intense vibrant quality. The hats and wool basket are built up with thick swaths of paint. They contrast strikingly with the girls’ porcelain-like faces, whose rosy coloring is painted with tiny brush strokes, giving their skin a smooth delicate effect."""
Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise (The Rowers' Lunch),829.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the late nineteenth century the picturesque little towns on the river Seine just west of Paris became popular destinations for Parisians wanting to enjoy a day out. This is one of many paintings made by Renoir at the restaurant Fournaise, which overlooked the river. The two men and a woman sit on one of the restaurant’s river terraces enjoying the summer afternoon after a leisurely lunch. They may all have spent the morning in more active pursuits. The man to the left was a well-known patron of a swimming establishment nearby. His friend to the right is dressed in a rower’s white shirt and pants, and their companion wears a female boater’s blue costume, as does the woman we see through the trellis. Beyond her a racing boat cuts through the water at a faster pace. On the terrace Renoir evokes the atmosphere of relaxation and quietness as the party lingers over wine and fruit. His soft, loose brushwork perfectly conveys the slightly hazy afternoon light. It filters through the trellis to fall glowingly on the men’s white costumes, and the thicker paint application highlights the edges of the wine glasses and decanter with points of dazzling dancing brilliance."""
Woman at the Piano,830.mp3,"""Narrator:  The artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir once wrote, “In antiquity and among simple peoples the woman sings and dances. Gracefulness is her domain and even her duty.” In this painting Renoir perfectly encapsulates this ideal, depicting music making as a graceful extension of female beauty. His subject is a pretty young woman dressed in a fashionably flowing indoor dress who plays the piano with a sense of poise and ease. We can imagine her fingers ranging softly over the keys bringing forth a melody as gentle and elegant as she herself. The woman does not exert herself with her playing, rather, she seems absorbed in the music, which gives the painting a meditative almost dreamlike quality. This is reflected by the way Renoir portrays the setting, with layers of intermingled curving brushstrokes that ensure nothing has a hard or definite edge. A soft, diffused light comes from an unseen window, illuminating the warm tones of her hands. Like the piano keys beneath them, almost everything in the room is touched with different shades of blue, which enhances the paintings calm, reflective atmosphere."""
Woman at Her Toilette,831.mp3,"""Narrator:  The theme of a woman before her mirror has a rich history. Its roots go back to renaissance images of the classical goddess, Venus admiring her own beauty. But this painting made by Berthe Morisot around 1880 is a more subtle and oblique interpretation of the theme. As a female artist she was much more restricted in her choice and treatment of subject matter than her male counterparts. Here, a woman undressing after a society ball is turned so that we see only the slightest glimpse of her profile, and she or perhaps the artist has positioned her mirror to discretely reflect only the crystal jar on her dressing stand and the flowers she may have worn in her hair. Her face remains tantalizingly out of view. Instead, we are invited to explore the creamy skin of her back revealed by her white cotton underdress, the fabric’s soft folds are described with crisscross brushstrokes. If you look carefully you may also be able to see the headboard of her bed seemingly floating on top of the floral wallpaper."""
"The Departure of the Boats, Étretat",832.mp3,"""Narrator:  By the mid 1880s, Monet had largely stopped making paintings of urban life in Paris. Instead, he immersed himself in the challenges of depicting the French landscape. He began using more acidic purples, mauves and pinks, in contrast to his earlier blue green palette. Monet arrived in the little fishing village of Etretat on the Normandy coast in the fall of 1895. He hoped to paint its towering dramatic cliffs without the summer clouds, but the stormy weather confined him to his hotel. Looking down from the top floor window of his hotel bedroom Monet began working on a series of canvases featuring the beach, with its fishing boats and sheds. In this version the weather has calmed enough to allow the fisherman to put out to sea. Beneath the leaden sky that speaks of the recent downpour their brightly painted boats with dark sails set off toward the horizon. On the beach itself, which glistens with wetness are three dark structures with steeply pitch tarred roofs. These are old fishing boats, now used for storage. Their landlocked forms contrast strikingly with the small, vulnerable boats out at sea, which must nevertheless go out daily to sustain the community."""
The Poet's Garden,833.mp3,"""Narrator:  Van Gogh painted this view of the public garden opposite his lodgings in the southern French town of Arles in September 1888. He had arrived in Arles from Paris earlier that year hoping to find new inspiration amid the vibrant colors and brilliant light of Provence. The garden, depicted with thick unblended brushstrokes seems full of the vigorous, almost wild forces of nature. The uncut grass in the foreground gives way to a dense mass of trees and bushes painted in every shade of green imaginable beneath a heat filled yellow green sky. In Provence, Van Gogh passionately wished to establish a utopian artist colony. His rented house in Arles would be its main studio. He hoped that the artist Paul Gauguin, whose work he deeply admired would be the first to join him there. Van Gogh planned to decorate his house with paintings in time for Gauguin’s arrival, and he intended this one for Gauguin bedroom, giving it the title “The Poet’s Garden.” In a letter to his brother he explained that the painting was meant to evoke the garden of Petrarch, the celebrated early renaissance Italian poet who spent time in Provence. This connection Van Gogh felt should in turn recall Gauguin, the new poet soon to arrive in Arles."""
Self-Portrait,834.mp3,"""Narrator:  Vincent van Gogh began his artistic career in his native Netherlands, making simple, often bleak depictions of peasant life in drawings and heavily dark toned paintings. In 1886, in his early thirties van Gogh arrived in Paris where his brother Theo already worked as an art dealer. Van Gogh’s exposure to the experimental, often brightly colored and light filled work of avant-garde artists then working and exhibiting there was a revelation to him. In particular, van Gogh admired the work of the young artist following on the heels of the impressionist such as Georges Seurat. In this self-portrait made in 1887 van Gogh explores the new color theories and techniques pioneered by Seurat and his circle. Following in Seurat’s footsteps, van Gogh builds up the painting with small dots of paint. He juxtaposes complimentary, or opposite colors to intensify their effect, for instance, the green and red in the background. The planes and contours of his thin, weary face are described with swift, lengthened brush strokes. They seem to radiate a nervous energy out toward the massive dots that swirls restlessly around his head."""
Ballet Dancers,836.mp3,"""Narrator:  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, like other artists working in late nineteenth century Paris was fascinated by the theatricality and artificial grace of the ballet. This work is one of this first ever depictions of the stage, made when he was very young. The painting, full of sly humor depicts tutu dancers in the midst of a performance. Their linear formation and repeated pose gives them a decorative if somewhat mechanical air, and their faces, like that of the stagehand in the top left corner are made almost grotesque by the livid yellow glow of the stage lights. Toulouse-Lautrec enlivens the empty space to the right with a witty depiction of the conductor’s large, hairy hands. They seem to mimic the movement of the dancer’s legs and feet. This is one of four ballet scenes Lautrec made as decorations for a countryside inn east of Paris, where he went to visit friends. He originally painted the scene on plaster.

Equestrienne (At the Cirque Fernando),837.mp3,"""Narrator:  The thrilling equestrian and acrobatic displays of Parisian circuses were rich source of inspiration to late nineteenth century artists. This painting by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec shows the Cirque Fernando, located in the bohemian Montmartre neighborhood where he lived. Lautrec went on to make many posters for clients, such as the Moulin Rouge nightclub. He was among the first artists to exploit the attributes of poster making in his paintings, such as large, legible images, a reduced range of colors, and a caricature-like style. Here, he focuses his caricaturist talents on the ringmaster, who menacingly whips the horse toward a paper hoop, through which the female acrobat must jump. The glance exchanged by the two performers crackles with tension. Its intensity contrasts strikingly with the impassive presence of the perfectly dressed bourgeois audience. Several of the spectators like the clowns are cropped abruptly by the edges of the canvas. Lautrec adapted this compositional technique in the flattened linear way he portrayed the figures from Japanese prints. These had become enormously popular and influential among avant-garde artists."""
Au Cirque: Écuyère,838.mp3,"""Narrator:  This wonderfully spontaneous seeming circus scene featuring a ringmaster and female equestrian was painted by Toulouse-Lautrec onto the leather skin of a tambourine. It was undoubtedly created around the same time as his celebrated large scale painting of the same subject, also hanging in this gallery. Here the tambourine shape allows Toulouse-Lautrec to experiment with the truly radical composition, and as with his poster art, to work outside the fine arts tradition of oil painting on canvas. As we look through its circular outer edge it takes on the form of the hoop. It’s as if the woman had just jumped and has landed again on the horse’s back, her limbs and costume a blur of swiftly brushed lines. Although we don’t know what prompted him to take on this instrument associated with Spanish dancers and bohemian life, the artist may have made this painting for the Café Tambourin in Montmartre. The café’s decor was entirely themed around the tambourine motif, with tables and chair shaped to resemble them, and real versions hung on the walls."""
"The Sacred Grove, Beloved of the Arts and the Muses",839.mp3,"""Narrator:  In a calm, Arcadian landscape bathed in golden light the nine muses, or classical patronesses of the arts gather in the sacred grove. The muses are crowned with leaves from the grove’s laurel trees and their decorous poses epitomize the balance and harmony they inspire in the arts. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes made the painting in the 1880s as a scaled down version of a mural he designed for a museum entry hall. Puvis worked at the same time as the impressionists and yet his approach to art was profoundly different. Rather than depicting modern subjects with experimental techniques Puvis drew on the classical themes and techniques of ancient Roman and renaissance Italian frescoes, or wall paintings. Following their example, he eliminated bright colors and strong contrasts of light and dark in favor of a limited range of chalky colors, muted tones, and flattened forms. Although Puvis looked back to the past for inspiration, avant-garde artists such as Gauguin and Seurat very much admired his paintings with their flat zones of color and shadowless, slightly mysterious figures who express themselves through ritualistic gesture."""
Apollo and Marsyas,840.mp3,"""Narrator:  This scene from classical mythology shows Apollo, god of music and of the sun standing in a grove of cypress trees. His muscular body is bathed in the sun’s golden light, and he holds his lyre at his side. Nearby stands the satyr, Marsyas. Apollo had challenged him to a musical contest angered by the Satyr’s pride in his flute playing. The story has a dark ending where the muses judge Apollo the winner, and Marsyas is flayed alive. The painting was made by the German artist Hans Thoma. It may seem strange that such a classical, seemingly traditional image was made in 1888. By then, French realists and impressionist paintings of modern life and radical new techniques had transformed the way art was made, and their influence had spread throughout Europe. Thoma and his circle wished to find a way to move beyond these new artistic conventions. To do so they drew on Greek and Roman mythology, and Germanic legends for subject matter. Thoma also looked for stylistic inspiration to the classicizing paintings of the preeminent French artist Purvis de Chavannes, whose work you can see in this gallery."""
Easter Mystery (Mystère de Pâques),841.mp3,"""Narrator:  Maurice Denis belonged to a group of young French artists who called themselves the Nabis after the Hebrew word for profits. The Nabis were interested in imbuing their subject matter with a sense of mystery and otherness. For Denis, a devout catholic, an ordinary landscape could be loaded with manifestations of the divine. Denis sets this scene, which he titled “Easter Mystery” in the village of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris, where he lived. The large house in the background would later become his home. In the foreground, an angel emerges from a cave, as if to announce Christ rising, to the mourning Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. Behind them are white clad figures who hasten toward an astonishing sight, the hand of God himself, appearing miraculously from the trees to offer the Eucharist. Denis strived for simple, flattened forms that sometimes verge on abstraction. He believed this process reflected spiritual purification, and he looked to the work of early Italian renaissance art, and especially to the work of the painter monk, Fra Angelico for inspiration. But he and the other Nabis were also deeply influenced by avant-garde French art. Here, Denis explores the effects of the pointillist technique of building up the picture surface with tiny dots of paint."""
The Big Tree (Te raau rahi),842.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the late 1880s the French artist Paul Gauguin dreamed of moving to some distant exotic place where he and his art could flourish, free from what he experienced as the taint of modern civilization. At the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris he saw displays of art and dancing from several nonwestern cultures, including Java. Entranced by these, and by fantasies of artistic rebirth and easy living in one of France’s colonial territories he made plans to settle abroad and establish what he called a studio of the tropics. After much deliberation, Gauguin finally settled on Tahiti and planned his departure. This painting was made a few months after Gauguin’s arrival in Tahiti in 1891. The idyllic landscape is filled with lush vegetation that nourishes and protects the people who live in the dwellings nearby. Beyond the figure in red, for instance, is a row of banana trees, and at the painting’s left side is a tall tree whose bark is tinged with violet. This is a hotu, whose pods and flowers were used by local people as remedies. At the lower left Gauguin inscribed the Tahitian words, “Te raau rahi,” meaning, the big tree. He often gave his works Tahitian titles to enhance their sense of mysterious exoticism for the European audience he intended should see and purchase his work."""
Day of the God (Mahana no Atua),843.mp3,"""Narrator:  In 1893, having spent two years in Tahiti in the South Pacific Gauguin returned to Paris eager to sell some of the work he had made there.  Although Gauguin's paintings made in the South Pacific mix reality and invention, here he is working in his Paris studio.  ""Day of the Gods"" is a brilliantly colored souvenir, a memory of his voyage, conjured up for a Paris audience.  The painting's composition is symmetrical and decorative and separates out the exotic cosmology of Tahiti from the natural world.  The three figures with the female bather in the center may represent birth, life, and death.  Behind them, women bring a tray of offerings to Hina, the ancient Polynesian moon goddess and co-creator of the universe.  The area to the right of the goddess seems devoted to love and sensuality.  Gauguin had gone to Tahiti in search of inspiration in the form of a simple, ancient culture.  He was keenly disappointed to discover that French Colonialism had all but erased the old beliefs.  Gauguin had to search anthropological texts for Polynesian legends and supplement his own sketches with images from books and photographs to create the mysterious, semi-imaginary world in his paintings."""
"Two Sisters, Valencia",845.mp3,"""Narrator:  The Spanish artist Joaquim Sorolla's ""Images of Children on the Beach"" were among his best-loved paintings.  Here, the older girl shades her eyes from the brilliant Spanish sun, which reflects rosily on her face.  Her younger sister, clutching her shift, looks down with the light at the water swirling around her feet.  Drawing upon Impressionist techniques, Sorolla fills the painting with light and movement.  The older girl's gown billows in the wind and catches the sun dazzlingly, and the rushing waves of the Mediterranean are evoked with large, swift, paint-laden brushstrokes.  They brighten almost to translucency in the foreground, where a reflective layer of shifting water covers the sand.  Joaquin Sorolla's work was well known in the United States as well as in Europe.  In 1907 he met Archer Milton Huntington, a notable art patron.  With his help, Sorolla's work was exhibited in many major American institutions.  These instituted the Art Institute to Chicago, where his work was shown in 1911.  This painting was acquired from that exhibition by a museum patron and has been here at the Art Institute ever since."""
Foliage—Oak Tree and Fruit Seller,846.mp3,"""Narrator:  Edouard Vuillard based this tranquil scene on the view from a balcony in a village house near Paris where he often spent the summer.  Vuillard made the painting as a decoration for the dining room of a Paris art dealer.  He used distemper, a mixture of powdered pigments bound by hot glue and water.  The distemper's soft, chalky colors and a craggy paint surface are perfect for depicting a mass of foliage.  Vuillard's painting also draws in 16th century Flemish tapestries for inspiration in its grand scale and its arrangement of figures seen between the leaves.  The painting is dominated by a great, spreading oak tree.  Beneath it is a lush, jungle-like tangle of garden plants, a harmonious mixture of greens, blues and yellows.  As we look at the painting, figures emerge from the pattern of foliage, sunlight and shadows.  A little girl turns to her dog or cat, while a woman behind her seems about to open the garden gate.  In the sunlit lane beyond, we just glimpse the fruit seller of the painting's title, and a woman hurrying home with a baguette.  What more do you see in the painting?"""
Virgin and Child,848.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the late 15th century, Hans Memling was the leading painter in the wealthy city of Bruges in the southern Netherlands.  He specialized in altarpieces and in exquisitely painted small devotional images used during private prayer, such as this one.  Curator Martha Wolff: 
Martha Wolff:  It shows the Virgin and Child at half-length as though they were appearing in a window opening.  The Virgin is handing him an apple, and the apple is probably a reference to the fall of man, to Adam and Eve, the eating of the apple and then the redemption of man through the coming of Christ.  
Narrator:  The back of the adjacent panel is shown here too.  It depicts St. Anthony of Padua carrying the Christ Child.  These two panels were originally hinged together, forming a diptych.  St. Anthony was the patron saint of the donor, the person who commissioned the diptych.  His portrait, now in poor condition, is on the other side.  When the diptych was open, the praying donor would have faced the Virgin and Child.  
Martha Wolff:  In the convex mirror behind the Virgin, you see a reflection of the window opening, and you also see two tiny figures, two little girls, as they appear to be, and these figures, these little girls, are not visible in the picture itself.  So it's unclear what they might be, but they are perhaps images of deceased children of the donor."""
Judith,849.mp3,"""Narrator:  This is Judith, the Old Testament heroine who rescued her people from the Assyrians.  Disarming their general, Holofernes, with her beauty, she entered his tent, encouraged him to drink too much, and then cut off his head.  The painting is by the Flemish artist Jan Sanders van Hemessen, who studied in Italy before settling in the city of Antwerp in the southern Netherlands.  Martha Wolff: 
Martha Wolff:  For me one of the fascinating things about this picture is the heroic quality of the nude figure of Judith, in contrast to the delicacy of the painting of her hair and of the beautiful silk bag in which she will put the head of the slain Holofernes.
Narrator:  Notice the striking juxtaposition of the transparent veil that floats down from Judith's braided hair with her enemy's severed head.  
Martha Wolff:  The contrast between the muscular figure and these delicate passages really emphasizes the quality of the nude as essentially a male figure with female attributes added to it, and this fits both probably with the experience of the painter in terms of his study of antique sculpture, of Renaissance painting, the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, probably on a trip to Italy that he would have undertaken in the 1520s, and it also fits with the heroic aspect of the figure."""
"Still Life with Dead Game, Fruits, and Vegetables in a Market",850.mp3,"""Narrator:  This lavishly stocked market stall was painted by Frans Snyders in 1614.  Snyders lived and worked in Antwerp, the southern Netherland's richest city.  He specialized in animal depictions.  Martha Wolff: 
Martha Wolff:  So what we have here is a tour de force of Frans Snyders as he treats the subject of market stalls and also by implication, I think, hunting pictures, because he has a lot of game mixed into the abundance of offerings on the market stall.  We have a dead swan, we have a deer, a boar, a peacock, and hares, and smaller birds as well, and we also have a witty play between the offerings in the market stall and the human and animal figures.  The man who is the keeper of the stall and who doffs his hat to the viewer is perhaps not paying sufficient attention to the boy who's about to pick his pocket on the left, and a similar kind of moralistic play perhaps occurs with the fighting cocks that are shown underneath the table and the cat that's watching them, perhaps ready to pounce on the weaker of the cocks.  You just see the glowing eyes of the cat underneath the market table."""
The Capture of Samson,851.mp3,"""Narrator:  In the center of this turbulent scene, the Old Testament hero Samson struggles against his captors, who are Philistines.  Samson's lover, Delilah, who betrayed him to the Philistines, reclines to the left.  She had discovered that Samson's strength lay in his hair, left long to symbolize an oath to God.  She ordered it to be cut as he slept.  His strength gone, Samson was then captured.  Rubens, the foremost Flemish Baroque artist painted this scene around 1610.  He had spent several years working and studying in Italy.  Here Samson's muscular body and dynamic struggling pose recall a celebrated antique sculpture in the Vatican collection in Rome.  Rubens made this small, loosely brushed painting as an oil study for a much larger work.  It is painted over an earlier sketch.  
Martha Wolff:  If you look at the upper right you'll see some drapery in blue and red that doesn't seem to make much sense in relation to the composition.  That's because he's taken an earlier sketch for the Adoration of the Magi and he's turned it around, upside-down, and he's just simply reused it to fill it with the story of Samson."""
The Music Lesson,852.mp3,"""Narrator:  This painting is by the Dutch 17th century artist Jacob Ochtervelt.  Curator Martha Wolff: 
Martha Wolff:  This is one of Ochtervelt's most graceful and delicate pictures, a masterpiece by the artist.  It has great delicacy of light and wonderful communication between the two figures who are engaged in music-making, which can have a moralizing implication of love and temptation and sensual pleasure.  
Narrator:  The woman gestures to a passage of music with her violin bow.  Her companion seems about to take up his theorbo, a type of lute.  The intimacy of their connection, conveyed through their exchanged glances, and the interdependent nature of the duet they are about to resume, may also suggest that their relationship is as harmonious as their playing.  The refinement of these people and their setting is suggested by the velvet-covered chair, as well as their expensive musical instruments and elegant clothing, and the large map on the wall reflects the fact that the Dutch were the foremost European cartographers and traders at this time."""
Two Cows and a Young Bull beside a Fence in a Meadow,853.mp3,"""Narrator:  Martha Wolff: 
Martha Wolff:  Paulus Potter's ""Two Cows and a Young Bull"" is really a tour de force of realism by a very young painter who specialized in the treatment of animals, and <break in recording> the Dutch Republic in the early 17th century was remarkably urban and was very rich from trade.  There was certainly a fascination with the land, a romance of land ownership and the country life, and probably this sort of subject fits in with that feeling.  The treatment of the two cows and the young bull is also almost a witty recreation of human interactions and emotions, as one thinks of the eager young bull staring out with bulging eyes towards the viewer and almost an animated expression, protective of these two very vividly observed cows that are relaxing in front of him; and one sees the realism of Paulus Potter's brushstrokes wonderfully preserved in the treatment of all the textures of the animals' hide, of the muddy ground, the distant pastureland, and the beautiful Dutch sky with the changeability of the clouds and the weather and the moist air of the Dutch landscape."""
"The Grand Canal, Venice",854.mp3,"""Narrator:  Beneath the wide sky, whose misty clouds hint at the changeable weather of Venice, business is carried out as usual on the Grand Canal.  Citizens visit the Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute on the right.  This splendid church was designed in thanks for the deliverance of the Venetian people from an outbreak of the plague in 1630.  Beyond the church you can see a little tower topped by a ball.  This is the city's customs house.  Its presence on the Grand Canal reminds us that Venice owed much of its historical wealth and power to its great trading prowess.  Black gondolas carrying passengers and commercial barges ply their trade on the water, and to the left is the large pink-colored palace of the doges, or rulers of Venice.  The scene is by Francesco Guardi.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  Guardi was one of the foremost ""vedute"", or view, painters of Venice in the 18th century.  He depicted many scenes in an exquisite painterly manner, using broad brushstrokes to create a vibrancy of mood and light that captures this everyday scene in Venice.  These pictures were prized in particular in the 18th century by British travelers who wanted a memory to bring back with them once they returned to England from their grand tours around Europe."""
Lady Sarah Bunbury Sacrificing to the Graces,857.mp3,"""Martha Wolff: This is a wonderful example of Sir Joshua Reynolds Grand Portrait style, and his career was mostly devoted to the painting of portraits for aristocratic sitters.  
Narrator:  At this period, history paintings, or scenes drawn from classical mythology, the Bible or history, were considered the noblest form of art.  Reynolds, who had studied art and antiquity in Italy, fused history painting with portraiture in his flattering portrayals of the English aristocracy, filled with classical allusions.  
Martha Wolff:  These classical references are reflected both in the subject, which shows a fashionable beauty sacrificing to the Three Graces, and by implication, she is their associate or perhaps even the Fourth Grace.  It's also reflected in the vaguely classical quality of her loose drapery, which is not really contemporary dress at all, but a sort of antique costume that he's put her into.  
Narrator:  Reynolds's scholarly approach to portraiture brought him great professional success, and he was appointed founding president of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1768.  This painting, first exhibited in London in 1765, no doubt helped burnish his growing reputation.  It depicts Lady Sarah Bunbury, who had attracted the admiration of the future King George III a few years earlier.  So a portrait of this celebrated beauty, shone as a goddess-like figure receiving a wreath from her fellow graces, would surely have drawn a good deal of attention among Reynolds's fashionable society clientele."""
Boy on a Ram,858.mp3,"""Narrator:  The Spanish artist Francisco Goya made this painting around 1787.  Martha Wolff: 
Martha Wolff:  This charming image of a small boy dressed up and riding on a ram is part of a suite of designs that Goya made for a series of tapestries that were to decorate the dining room of the heir to the throne of Spain.  The whole room was to be lined by tapestries, and the largest ones were to show the four seasons, and then over the doors and smaller spaces in the room, he designed these playful and decorative subjects, including the boy on a ram; and this painting was actually the full-scale cartoon to be used by the weavers in the making of the tapestry.
Narrator:  Goya playfully lowers the horizon line in the painting so that the little boy seems to dominate the landscape.  Its lush blues and greens contrast decoratively with his black and red silk outfit, while the sunlight is inventively reflected up onto his face from his white frilled collar.  The idea of a boy riding a ram fits perfectly with the fanciful themes of the other tapestry designs.  
Martha Wolff:  Some of the other over-doors include whimsical things like a fight between two cats.  So I think it's for the amusement and delight of the people who were conversing in the dining room."""
Virgin and Child with the Young Saint John the Baptist,859.mp3,"""Narrator:  This painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Correggio was made as a private devotional image.  It depicts the Madonna, who tenderly encircles the Christ Child on her lap, and the young St. John the Baptist with her arms.  Notice how Correggio paints her face.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  There's a softness in the modeling, in the contours of the face, that's incredibly subtle and beautiful and really just captures a mood that's very peaceful and loving and gentle, and it's a meditative image, because when you look at her lids, she's looking down.  She's not looking at the viewer.  She's really thinking about the relationship to the Christ Child and to John the Baptist.  
Narrator:  Mary's downward gaze suggests her knowledge of her son's fate.  Christ himself looks towards the other child, who holds a slender cross made of reeds, a visual reminder of the cross on which Christ will eventually die.  Meanwhile, the trellis behind Mary deepens the painting's symbolism.  Its citrus fruits are sometimes seen as emblems of faithfulness and love, but in their bitterness, they may also allude to Christ's future death and his mother's grief."""
Virgin and Child with an Angel,860.mp3,"""Narrator:  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  This painting by Botticelli shows the Virgin and the Christ Child embracing, and then to the left you see an angel who is gazing upon the scene with an upturned face.  
Narrator:  The figures are placed within an interior whose form suggests those of Roman architecture.  
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  And we should understand in this period that there was a great interest in reviving the classical past and looking towards antique sculpture as well as classical architecture, and even within the figures themselves, there's almost a relief-like quality.  
Narrator:  Botticelli worked in Florence during the Italian Renaissance.  He and other Renaissance artists were interested in bringing greater realism to their portrayals of the human body, often using classical sculpture as inspiration.  Here Botticelli depicts the whole of the Christ Child's body as he stands on the Virgin's lap.  His arms lovingly encircle his mother's neck, and his rounded face presses closely to the smooth planes of her cheek.  These details convey the three-dimensionality of their bodies, as well as the intimacy of their embrace."""
Venus and Cupid,862.mp3,"""Narrator:  Several details of this painting indicate that this is no ordinary mother and baby caught during a quiet moment of intimacy.  The doves nestling behind the pink drapery tell us that the woman is Venus, goddess of love and beauty.  Her child is Cupid, whose magic arrows cause whoever they strike to fall in love with the next person they see.  Cupid's arrows in their quiver lie beside the bed.  The painting was made around 1570 by Luca Cambiaso, then the foremost painter in the wealthy northern Italian city of Genoa.  Cambiaso was deeply influenced by the luminous paintings of Venetian Renaissance artists such as Titian.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  And it's really about exquisite surface and luxury items.  So there's the sense of this silvery light, but there's also this attention to detail, when you look at the way in which there's attention paid to even the tassels on the pillows upon which Venus is reclining, or the sense of light and movement on the draperies that have been pulled apart to reveal the scene."""
Kitchen Scene,863.mp3,"""Narrator:  This remarkable painting is one of the very earliest known by the Spanish 17th century master Diego Velazquez.  He depicts a woman in a dark interior.  Around her are earthenware bowls and pitchers, a basket hanging on the wall, and a garlic bulb that she is perhaps about to crush in the pestle and mortar beside it.  These objects are ordinary.  They might have been found in any kitchen in the southern Spanish city of Seville, where the young Velazquez was then training as an artist.  But with breathtaking virtuosity, he raises them far above their humble, everyday status.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  What I think is fascinating is that the loving attention that's paid to the sense of texture and what would be the smooth surface of the glaze, in particular, on the pieces of pottery to the left.  
Narrator:  In Seville at this time, bodegones, or still life paintings of kitchen or pantry objects, were popular.  Here, Velazquez seems to be following in that tradition, yet he also includes the woman, probably a Moorish servant, descended from the North African people who inhabited and ruled parts of southern Spain for many centuries.  Velazquez treats this woman, with her thoughtful expression and white sleeve and turban, with the same astonishing and reverent attention to detail and texture as he pays to the still life elements around her."""
The Crucifxion,864.mp3,"""Narrator:  This extraordinary evocation of the crucifixion is by the Spanish 17th century artist Zurbaran.  Christ's body is depicted with an incredible realism, intended to inspire a profound spiritual response.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  Within Spanish devotional painting of this period, there's a great religious fervor.  This scene has been pared down to a dark background, and the focus really is on the agony and suffering of the crucified Christ.  
Narrator:  This altarpiece was painted for a monastery in the southern Spanish city of Seville.  Zurbaran designed it to hang above an altar in the tiny sacristy which was screened by an iron grille.  This space for preparations before the mass was lit by windows to the right, whose illumination Zurbaran mimics and intensifies in the painting.  A later 17th century art historian and painter, Antonio Palomino, was deeply impressed with its astonishingly convincing depiction of Christ's dying body.  He wrote: ""There is a crucifix from his, Zurbaran's, hand, which is shown behind a grille of the chapel, which has little light, and everyone who sees it and does not know believes it to be sculpture."""""
The Resurrection,865.mp3,"""Narrator:  At the top of this enormously dramatic painting, Christ miraculously rises from the dead after his crucifixion and burial.  Beneath him, an angel in white gestures upward, commanding the attention of the soldiers who have been sleeping as they guard Christ's tomb.  Their astonishment at this miracle is vividly expressed in their faces.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  You have the sense of individuals in life reacting to a very shocking experience, an unexpected experience, and you see it marked all over the faces, which is heightened by this sense of these bright lights that shine upon one half of the face and then leave the other side of the face in shadow.  So there's a great theatricality and a great drama to the use of light in this painting.
Narrator:  The painting was made in Rome around 1620 by Cecco del Caravaggio, a close follower of the short-lived Baroque master Caravaggio.  Cecco adopted Caravaggio's innovations.  These instituted a bold use of chiaroscuro, or contrasts of light and dark, and painting from live models rather than using drawings, as was common practice in this period, to create this realistic scene.  Here we can imagine the model for Christ kneeling on a cushion, which the artist has transformed into a cloud, and the classical relief in the lower right corner was a well-known Roman fragment, which Cecco must have seen and copied."""
Cupid Chastised,866.mp3,"""Narrator:  This theatrical scene sets war against peace or love.  In the center, Cupid, the Roman boy-god of love, lies blindfolded.  Mars, god of war, is about to beat the boy, while his mother Venus, goddess of love, looks on fearfully.  Here Mars, who was Venus's lover, punishes Cupid for causing his mother to fall in love with the handsome Adonis.  The painting was made by Bartolomeo Manfredi, a follower of the early 17th century master Caravaggio.  Manfredi's painting is full of Caravaggio-like dramatic contrasts of light and shadow and naturalistic detail.  Notice, for instance, the hairs on Mars's hand, and the lifelike rendering of Cupid's smooth skin.  But other aspects of the painting are more idealized.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  There's also a great element of sensuality in terms of the nude flesh of Cupid, who is not shown as a young child but rather as a young nubile boy.  In contrast to that, or almost as a foil, the figure of Venus, her body and her face have a much more static quality.  They come much more from a tradition of classical sculpture.  You don't have a sense that the face of Venus was executed from a figure from life."""
The Entombment,867.mp3,"""Narrator:  Illuminated by a glowing, heavenly light, the dead Christ is tenderly and reverently lowered into his tomb by his followers.  His pale body is as idealized as a classical marble sculpture.  Only discreet holes in his hand and foot indicate his terrible death on the cross, which looms in the background.  Surrounding Christ are his closest supporters.  To the left is his faithful follower, Mary Magdalene.  Her upward glance reminds us that Christ will shortly ascend into Heaven.  The older man is Nicodemus, a Jewish temple official, who came to Christ for instruction.  To the right is Christ's discipline John, and in the center, underlining her place in Christ's story, is the Virgin Mary.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  There's a sense of a timeless grief that's captured by the Virgin's clasped hands before her face, where in fact her grief is so great that we see the left tear on her cheek, but that the right side of her face is obscured, because it is a grief that is too great to be seen.  
Narrator:  While the profound emotions of these figures are expressed with restraint, the turbulent sky and stark trees in the background seem to articulate their sense of desolation.  The painting is by Guercino, one of the foremost painters of the northern Italy city of Bologna in the mid 17th century."""
The Vision of Saint Francis,868.mp3,"""Narrator:  In this scene by Ludovico Carracci, the earthly and heavenly realms almost seem to touch one another.  This is brought about with a vision of St. Francis of Assisi, in which he saw the Virgin Mary.  Here she looks down at him majestically from Heaven, having given him the Christ Child to hold.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  There's extreme care and attention paid to his expression of devotion.  There's even a small dab of white paint in his right eye that almost is a suggestion of a tear forming.  He is moved, and one should understand this as a religious and devotional painting that a patron could have used in their own home to meditate on this vision of Christ.  
Narrator:  The image is painted on copper, giving it an incredibly smooth, jewel-like surface.  It also intensifies the radiance of the heavenly light that emanates from the Virgin and Child."""
Pastoral Scene,869.mp3,"""Narrator:  In this enigmatic painting by the 18th century Venetian artist Piazzetta, a woman sits in a rocky, dramatic landscape.  The two men, like the woman, are clothes in a picturesque, or artistic, version of peasant dress.  They seem to rest from a walk, or perhaps from their day's work, and in the foreground a small boy steps tentatively toward the river, in which a duck rises, startled by two hunting dogs.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  This painting by Piazzetta has puzzled many scholars for many years.  
Narrator:  It has been suggested that the boy represents Christ as a child, or a young Bacchus, the Roman god of wine.  He does have a basket of grapes, after all.  
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  Now, it's also been questioned whether we should understand the figures whose faces have a very realistic aspect as portraits of the artist's family.  
Narrator:  But the sensuality of the woman's direct gaze and revealing garment makes it seem unlikely that the artist would have portrayed his wife in such a way.  Whatever the meaning of the scene might be, its rich, warm coloring, theatrical charm, and bravura brushwork are typical of its Venetian origins."""
Portrait of the Man in Spanish Costume,870.mp3,"""Narrator:  This striking depiction of an older man was painted by the French 18th century artist Jean-Honore Fragonard.  Fragonard is best known for his playful scenes of fashionably dressed lovers in idyllic gardens, commissioned to decorate his aristocratic clients' houses.  He also painted a series of male and female heads, including this wonderfully craggy old man.  The exact meaning or identity of most of the heads in this series is still unknown.  Like this man, several wear costumes that seem to allude to the past, or perhaps to theatrical garb.  These paintings are full of painterly brio and virtuosity.  Some even bear labels stating that they were painted in an hour.  This man's pose may be a witty artistic allusion.  He leans on a pedestal, with his other hand on his hip, recalling sitters in Grand Baroque portraits of kings and aristocrats.  Yet Fragonard undercuts the grandeur of the pose by emphasizing the man's droopy eyes, his reddened nose and cheeks, and flowing beard.  He seems to exaggerate his appearance almost to the point of caricature.  Notice Fragonard's extraordinary free way of painting.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer: 
Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  You can see the brushstrokes in the background in the lighter tones, where the artist has really imbued the painting with an energy and a vigor, and the freedom of the costume, the open chemise, this vest that's sketched in, have sort of a levity and a lightness that really does give this painting a theatrical air."""
Explosion at Sea,908.mp3,"""Narrator:  This disturbing glimpse of destruction is by the artist Vija Celmins, whose family was forced to flee their native Latvia during World War II.  Celmins's painting depicts an attack on an aircraft carrier in extraordinary detail.  Like many of her works from the period, it is a meticulous re-presentation of a photograph from the artist's collection of images of war and disaster.  Here is Celmins talking about her approach to her work:
Vija Celmins:  I started painting clippings that I had been collecting not from the photo but of the photo, which is a little bit of a difference.  I think that the war, World War II, in which I was a child and about which I knew nothing-- believe me-- I was thinking as I was trying to find something that was maybe more mine, like your own car that you can drive, your own understanding of things.  I went back to images that are kind of remembered images, and I got so seduced by the grays.  In the back of my mind I was thinking that I had a sort of a somberness in my work, very un-Southern-California-like.  They didn't know what to make of me."""
Red Yellow Blue White and Black,912.mp3,"""Narrator:  This monumental painting, entitled simply, ""Red Yellow Blue White and Black"", is by Ellsworth Kelly.  He made it in 1953 while living in Paris.  Curator James Rondeau:
James Rondeau:  This picture was realized at a crucial moment near the end of Kelly's sojourn in Paris just as he was beginning to really uncover what proves to be the near infinite possibilities of the monochrome, the color spectrum, chance ordering, and multi-panel composition.  What Kelly I think wants us to see here are the most pared-down basics of color and form and the relationship to one another, how color is defined by shape, how shape defines color, how we read colors in relationship one to the other, how blue reads differently next to red than it reads next to white, how the center black panel in a way holds this seven-panel composition together, but also the relationship between the individual panels and the wall that surrounds them.  In a traditional landscape painting you might have a tree in the near space and a mountain in the far space.  Those notions of foreground and background that we think about in compositional terms, if we take that basic structure when examining these works, the foreground of this experience are the panels themselves, and the background is the wall, or the architectural space which surrounds them."""
"Wall Drawing #63: A wall is divided into four horizontal parts.",915.mp3,"""<glockenspiel music>
Narrator:  The title of this elegant, gossamer-like drawing by Sol LeWitt describes exactly how it was created.  A wall is divided into four horizontal parts.  In the top row are four equal divisions, each with lines in a different direction; in the second row, six double combinations; in the third row, four triple combinations; in the bottom row, all four combinations superimposed.  The artist was inspired by mathematically-derived formulations.  For him they expressed an idea that was the essential kernel of that particular work.  But when his formulations are executed and become tangible artworks, the results are often unexpectedly beautiful.  This drawing, like many of LeWitt's works, was actually made by a team of trained draftsmen.  In a way, its full title is like a musical score that the team performs directly on the museum's wall.  This is the second time that the drawing has been made here since it entered the Art Institute's collection in 1985.  As the piece for the artist is principally about the collaborative expression of an idea, it can be removed from a wall and then remade repeatedly over time.  LeWitt's belief that a concept or idea was the most important part of making art is true as well for many of the other conceptual artists whose work is displayed in this gallery."""
"""Untitled""",923.mp3,"""Narrator:  Look up.  The words running around the walls of this gallery are a work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres.  They recall the kind of architectural decoration often carved on the walls of public buildings, but they're also a form of self-portrait.  Curator James Rondeau:
James Rondeau:  Gonzalez-Torres is trying to I think say that any life is made up between public and private events.  So you see that, as you look around the room, a number of readily identifiable points in history-- the Great Society, 1964; the Civil Rights Act, also 1964; Berlin Wall, 1989; Black Monday, 1987-- and those are all combined with things that are essentially very private-- Red Canoe, 1987; Julie, 1987, Sloan Kettering, 1995.  Many of those references have to do with illness and disease.  Gonzalez-Torres was an artist living with HIV/AIDS.  He died of the disease in 1996.
Narrator:  Remarkably, Gonzalez-Torres engineered this self-portrait so that it would continue to grow and change beyond his own lifetime.  He stipulated that this piece's owner should add to this sequence of events as they see fit.  This is the first time the museum has done so since acquiring Gonzalez-Torres's self-portrait.  To hear about these additions, press Play."""
American Collectors (Fred and Marcia Weisman),937.mp3,"""Narrator:  In 1964, the young English artist David Hockney arrived in California, whose brilliant light, bright colors, and crisp, dark shadows dazzled and inspired him.  This painting depicts the Los Angeles art collectors Fred and Marcia Weisman.  Mr. Weisman, standing stiffly in profile, seems to resemble the unyielding abstract vertical sculpture in front of him.  Curator James Rondeau:
James Rondeau:  One terrific detail of the painting is that Mr. Weisman's fist seems to be clenched so tightly that it actually is dripping paint down the leg of his pants.  So the artist reminds us not only that the figure is made of paint, but there seems to be a kind of psychological and emotional tension here that is so great that the figure almost seems to be dissolving before our eyes.
Narrator:  In contrast to her husband, Mrs. Weisman meets her gaze, seemingly very aware that both she and her art collection are on display.  Her frontal pose is reflected by the central sculpted figure by the famous British artist Henry Moore, while her smile echoes that of the slightly menacing face on the totem pole."""
The Beginning,938.mp3,"""James Rondeau:  This painting is called ""The Beginning"".  In it we can see three pale yet distinct lines emerge from the painting's base.
Narrator:  That was curator James Rondeau.  The painting, which was made in 1946, is one of Barnett Newman's earliest surviving works.  Newman would become known as one of the greatest of the Abstract Expressionists, who aimed in their work to access a deeper knowledge of self and of the poetic sublime in nature.  
James Rondeau:  Newman's signature device was the use of a vertical stripe set off against a chromatic field, a motif he called a zip, and here we see the origins of what would become the zip motif in a painting both titled and structured around the notion of dawn.  So the title at the beginning seems to refer to the dawning of a new day, whereas the zip motifs here, for really the first and only time in Newman's career, are evocative of the rays of a rising sun."""
Living Sculpture,939.mp3,"""Narrator:  These huge hanging aluminum works defy convention and expectation in many ways.  Suspended from the ceiling instead of rising from a plinth as a traditional sculpture would do, they suggest great organic vines.  Their sinuous, spiraling forms, which are made from thin sheets of industrial aluminum, seem both more fragile and more alive than we would expect metal to be.  This organic quality is emphasized by their brightly painted floral designs.  Part of a much larger work entitled ""Living Sculpture"", these pieces were made in the 1960s by Marisa Merz.  James Rondeau:
James Rondeau:  Marisa Merz belongs to a group of Italian artists who, in the late 1960s, pioneered an artistic movement known as Arte Povera.  Arte Povera, ""poor art"", was so named because of the artists' attraction to simple, everyday, or humble materials, both manmade and natural.
Narrator:  Merz made these works to transform her own living and working space.
James Rondeau:  So these hung from the ceiling in her apartment in Turin, Italy, where she lived and worked.  She was interested in creating an environment that had magical meanings, transforming her living space into a forest or a hive or a cave or even a kind of womb."""
"""Untitled"" (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)",924.mp3,"""Narrator: This pile of candy is an untitled work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres. Curator James Rondeau:

James Rondeau: This work is actually a portrait. The amount of candy here, 175 pounds, is equivalent to the body weight of Felix&#39;s partner, Ross Laycock-- Ross's ideal body weight at perfect health. He was suffering from HIV and ultimately died of AIDS.

Narrator: Feel free to take a piece of candy. Your doing so is part of this piece.

James Rondeau: The activity surrounding the work mimics Ross';s illness. The amount of candy in the pile diminishes in a way that parallels Ross's own weight loss while he was ill. So the work is actually very much a double-edged sword. In one sense, there's a very sweet and sincere and easy gesture of generosity. On the other hand, we're encountered not only to take a piece of candy, but to metaphorically reduce a symbol for Ross Laycock's own body as the disease reduced him. As in so many works by this artist, the joy and the celebration and the beauty inherent in his works of art are tinged with melancholy and sadness. Gonzalez-Torres stipulated that the pile should be continuously replenished, thus granting perpetual life to a work that memorializes a lost loved one."""
Tripod Wine Vessel (Jia),950.mp3,"""Narrator:  As long as 3000 years ago in China, bronze vessels like this were used to heat wine over fire.  Two rows of monster-like masks with bulging eyes wrap around the body of the vessel.  Abstract serpents slither down the legs.  The head of a horned, cow-like creature sits atop the handle.  Yet the exact meaning of these designs is one of the great mysteries of ancient Chinese art.  What is not so much a mystery though is the complex and ingenious process that created the vessels' dramatic form and elaborate surface designs.  It's called piece-mold casting, and was a collaboration between Shang potters and metalworkers.  It began with a piece of clay molded into the shape of the vessel.  The clay was cut into pieces and each inner surface was then inscribed with designs, fired, and reassembled around a clay core, leaving a hollow space between the core and the mold pieces.  Hot metal was poured into the core, and when it solidified and cooled, the clay was dug out, leaving behind the creation you see here.  If you look closely, you can still see traces of the original clay in the holes of the base.  In ancient China, wine was fermented not from fruit but from grains, like beer today.  The heated wine was offered in elaborate rituals of ancestor worship that were intended to ensure divine goodwill.  Conducting these rituals was the prerogative of kings and nobles of the Shang dynasty, who ruled part of what is now Central China in the 12th century B.C.  This vessel was probably used on a temple altar and then buried as a gift to the ancestors.  Kate Sturges Buckingham, who lived in the late 19th century, gave this piece and other a thousand other works to the Art Institute.  Once called Chicago's grandest spinster, she inherited the family fortune from banking, steel and real estate, and became an avid supporter of arts in Chicago along with her brother, Clarence.  She gave her distinguished collection of Chinese bronzes in memory of her sister Lucy Maud, who was an invalid.  She also donated the funds to build Buckingham Fountain just a few blocks away on Columbus Drive in memory of her brother Clarence."""
Incense Burner in the Form of a Duck,951.mp3,"""Narrator:  For me, this porcelain incense burner is wonderfully playful and embodies the aesthetic refinement and technical sophistication of the Northern Song dynasty, which ruled China from the late 10th to the early 12th century A.D.  This incense burner is shaped like a duck sitting on an open lotus flower.  It was probably made for a scholar, artist, government official or wealthy merchant, someone who would have appreciated its elegance as well as its function.  Incense was highly prized at that time.  It was thought to dispel gloom, induce a meditative state, and enhance creativity.  The fragrant smoke would have wafted from the duck's mouth and from the two holes beneath its feet, though you can see only one of those holes here.  Among the triumphs of the ceramicist's technique are the fine white porcelain body, subtle bluish-white glaze, and the articulation of feathers on the wings and tail, which catch the light and give life to the form.  This remarkable object came to the Art Institute from Russell Tyson.  Born in Shanghai in 1867, Tyson eventually moved to Chicago, where he became one of the city's most astute collectors of Asian art.  His passion led him to found the Orientals, a social outlet for both scholars and collectors, which features seminars, lectures, and concerts.  Many in the group, including Kate Buckingham, laid the foundation for the museum's world-class collection of Asian art."""
Horse,952.mp3,"""Narrator:  This lively earthenware horse dates back to the 5th and 6th centuries A.D., during what is known as Japan's Kofun, or old tombs, era.  It would have marked the grave of a royal or noble personage.  It's called a haniwa, referring to clay figures set around a funeral mound.  The earliest haniwa were simple clay cylinders, and the cylindrical legs of this horse may reflect that original shape.  But there's an appealing realism here in the more detailed treatment of the saddle, stirrups, and dangling bell ornaments.  Horses were imported to Japan from Central Asia.  As instruments of war, they served as symbols of wealth and power.  Other haniwa take the shape of animals such as roosters, birds, deer, dogs, and even human figures, small houses, and boats.  Unlike Chinese tomb sculptures, haniwa are never glazed so that they retain a visual link to the earth.  Robert Allerton, a great benefactor to the museum, gave this haniwa to the Art Institute.  He served as both trustee and honorary president and donated over 6600 works of art during his lifetime.  The museum's original building on Michigan Avenue, flanked by our lions, was built in 1893 in conjunction with the World's Fair, held in Chicago.  The building bears his name."""
Yakushi Nyorai,953.mp3,"""Narrator:  This image of the Buddha of healing was carved in Japan in the 10th or 11th century A.D.  It shows the enlightened Buddha, called Yakushi Nyorai, with his right hand raised in a gesture of reassurance and his left hand holding a medicine bottle, signifying his power to heal.  With legs crossed and eyes closed, Yakushi Nyorai assumed the traditional meditative pose.  He is seated on a lotus throne, a symbol of nirvana, the final stage of enlightenment.  Other signs of his enlightened state are the dot or third eye between his eyebrows and the bun-like bump on his head, which both signify wisdom.  One belief scholars have held is that his elongated earlobes may reference the heavy gold earrings the historical Buddha wore as a prince before he renounced all worldly goods to pursue enlightenment.  Buddhism spread from its Indian homeland to China and then reached Japan around the 7th century A.D.  Without supplanting Japan's indigenous religious practices, known as Shinto, Buddhism has a tremendous impact normal Japanese culture and art.  Yakushi Nyorai was an especially popular cult figure.  He was believed to bring his devotees not just relief from spiritual and physical suffering, but material success as well.  This sculpture was originally painted, at least in part.  Look closely.  You can see traces of the original red pigment on his face and the robe on the left shoulder."""
Marriage of Shiva and Parvati (Kalyanasundara) with Brahma and Vishnu in Attendance,954.mp3,"""Narrator:  This high-relief sandstone panel, created by anonymous sculptors in the 10th or 11th century, would have originally been seen on a temple wall.  It shows four-armed Shiva, one of the chief gods of the Hindu pantheon, with his consort Parvati.  Shiva, on the right, accepts the hand of Parvati, who stands at the far left of the panel.  They are enacting the key moment in a Hindu marriage ceremony, equivalent to the exchange of rings in a Western wedding.  When the bride places her right hand in the right hand of the groom, it's called ""accepting the hand"".  This is how Hindu couples have solemnized marital commitment for millennia.  The divine marriage of Shiva and Parvati, which represents the union of the male and female forces of nature, is considered the model of a happy Hindu marriage.  Their wedding ceremony was attended by all the gods.  The small figure in the center is Brahma, the creator, who officiates at the ceremony.  The small figure in the lower right is Vishnu, the preserver, who gives the bride away.  Like most of the objects in this gallery, this wedding relief comes from the extraordinary collection of James and Marilynn Alsdorf.  As a couple, they traveled together throughout Southeast Asia and collected works focused on the traditional arts of India, the Himalayas, and Southeast Asia.  The works they cherished, like this one, often depict customs that are very much alive today."""
Buddha with Left Hand in Gesture of Gift Giving (Varadamudra),955.mp3,"""Narrator:  This bronze statue of Buddha was made in the 11th or 12th century at the southern tip of India, a part of the subcontinent ruled by a dynasty of kings known as the Chola.  Some of the symbolism is familiar from earlier Buddhist sculpture, such as the dot between the eyebrows signifying wisdom.  His hand gestures-- the right offering reassurance, the left outstretched and giving-- are long established in Buddhist, as is the pointed flame atop the Buddha's head, which stands for the light of true knowledge.  But the gracefully draped robe, with its scalloped folds at the hem, are newer motifs, arising from the mixture of cultures in the Chola empire.  At its height, this empire extended from Northern India and across the sea to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia.  Commerce flourished, with trade partners ranging from the Near East to China.  The arts were generously supported and bronze sculpture, such as this work, reached a rare degree of elegance and sophistication.  This statue was cast in the major South Indian port city of Nagapattinam, where monks and traders interacted and new artistic styles emerged.  This elegant bronze was purchased with funds from an endowment established by Samuel M. Nickerson, a Chicago banker and an early benefactor, who began donating art to the museum in 1900."""
Drinking Horn,956.mp3,"""Narrator:  This drinking horn from the 19th century was a status symbol for a Kuba warrior.  The origins of the Kuba kingdom, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, date back to the 16th century.  The kingdom's complex hierarchy includes many titles and ranks, which are represented through status symbols in the form of elaborate regalia and utilitarian objects.  Drinking horns were sometimes carved out of actual bush buffalo horn, but this vessel is ingeniously sculpted in wood to resemble a buffalo horn.  Fierce and dangerous, the bush buffalo was a fitting symbol of military prowess for Kuba warriors.  The twisted and looped iron attachment allowed it to be worn suspended from a belt at important public occasions.  Take a walk around the object to appreciate all of its wonderful details.  On one side, the bold relief decorations include a lizard or crocodile.  On the other, a small human hand and geometric patterns.  Kuba artists used these patterns to embellish sculpted objects of many kinds.  Look closely at the lizard-like creature and you will see small dots of copper alloy embedded in its body.  Copper, a valued material in the 19th century, is another sign that this horn was a highly valued object.  George F. Harding, a Chicago businessman, politician and art collector with a special interest in arms and armor and the art of the American West, gave this handsome drinking horn to the museum.  In 1927, Harding saw the horn on display as part of the exhibition at the Art Institute that juxtaposed African art with works by African American artists.  He purchased it for the museum because he wanted to expose a wider audience to the major influence that African art had on the development of modern art in Europe and America."""
Headdress (Ci Wara Kun),957.mp3,"""Narrator:  With their formal grace and balance, these African headdresses are the finest pair in any collection in the United States.  They were made probably over a century ago by a Bamana sculptor and blacksmith.  The Bamana are a Mande-speaking people who live in what is now Southern Mali in West Africa.  Bamana sculptors and blacksmiths played an essential role in making tools for farming, weapons for hunting and protection, and works of art for ritual interactions with the supernatural realm.  These sculptures are called headdresses because they attached to capes worn by costumed dancers.  Imagine how they'd look during a dance and what it must be like to wear these heavy objects.  Talk about the sculptures to experience them from all sides.  The larger figure sports the proud horns and elaborate mane of a male antelope, symbolizing strength and energy.  He also has the tapered snout of an anteater, which burrows industriously into the earth for food.  The slightly smaller female figure is similar in form and bears a baby on her back, representing fertility not only of animals but also of people, and of the community's corn and millet fields.  One notable feature of both headdresses is how their two dies virtually disappear when viewed from the front or back.  This design creates a stimulating visual effect during a dance performance.  Look up at the wall to see a video showing these headdresses being worn in performances today.  Working in wood with additions of hammered metal, brass tacks and dried grasses, the artist has evoked the tools that allow a Bamana farmer to produce an abundant harvest.  Acquired for the Art Institute in 1965, the headdresses are notable for their masterful melding of representation and geometric abstraction.  This was a hallmark of objects favored by mid-20th century collectors of African art, who saw a parallel to the formal concerns Western artists were exploring in their own work."""

This pair of small beakers shows the extraordinary talents of metalwork artists from the Inca Empire.  At the time of the Spanish Conquest in 1532, the Inca reigned over some 10 million people from their capital Cuzco, in modern-day Peru.  Made from hammered gold, the beakers feature raised motifs that include a flock of birds in a stylized field of corn or maize.  The Inca rulers claimed descent from the sun god, Inti, who was symbolized by gold, a rare material that was considered sacred.  The ownership, display, and use of gold objects were restricted to Inca royalty and the uppermost elite.  Tumbler-shaped vessels like these were typically made in matched pairs.  They were used during royal feasting ceremonies to drink and made toasts with corn beer, as well as to offer ritual libations to the ancestors, supernatural beings, and the sacred powers of the natural world.  The Art Institute's extensive holdings of ancient art from the Andes Mountains were principally formed in the mid-1950s, with the purchase of over 1000 ceramics, textiles and metal works, including these gold beakers.  They were formerly from the collection of Dr. Edward Gaffron, who lived in Lima, Peru, from 1892 to 1912."""
Model Depicting a Ritual Center,959.mp3,"""Narrator:  Examining this sculpted representation of a ritual center is like looking back in time.  It was created by artists from a culture known as the Nayarit that flourished in West Central Mexico from around 100 to 800 A.D.  The Nayarit presented a vivid record of their daily activities and sacred rituals in earthenware models like this one.  Here we see dozens of people gather in a circular plaza centered on a tiered pyramid.  They dance to music provided by flute players, drummers, and conch shell trumpeters, while curious parrots look on from the rooftops of the temples or houses that surround this lively performance.  On top of the main structure is a figure holding a staff in his right hand, mostly certainly the leader of the community.  He is masked and wears an ornate headdress that flows over his face and onto his shoulders.  The four buildings around the outer perimeter of the plaza likely reference east, west, north, and south.  This scene probably depicts a cosmological festival, a community-wide ritual linked to the cycle of the seasons that celebrated the larger order of the universe.  Nayarit ceramic sculptures, including models, human figures and vessels, are often found buried in the tombs of revered ancestors.  These offerings would have been enlivened with multicolored pigments representing the body paint and patterned textiles that the ancient Nayarit wore and used to decorate their buildings.  This work is one of several ancient West Mexican pieces that were given to the museum by Ethel and Julian R. Goldsmith.  Professor Goldsmith, a native of Chicago, was a distinguished scholar of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago."""
Cabinet,960.mp3,"""Narrator:  This 17th century cabinet is a marvel of fine craftsmanship with many surprises inside.  Behind the elaborate external, with its graceful flourishes of carved ivory, lie even more exquisite wonders awaiting discovery by the curious viewer.  Take a moment to walk around the cabinet.  As you do, remember that this usually would have been seen with its doors closed, not open, as it is here.  The decoration becomes richer the deeper you go.  The front doors open to reveal carved figures on pedestals, bronze drawer pulls shaped like lions' heads, and ivory pictures depicting hunting scenes.  The dominant theme is hunting with falcons using 17th century weaponry such as crossbows, nets, and firearms.  There are also mythological scenes.  The central panel shows Icarus, the mythical Greek boy who tried to fly to the sun on wings held together by wax, only to fall to his death when the wax melted.  At the very top of the cabinet, look for the ivory figure which represents the Christian virtue of charity.  Constructed in Augsburg, Germany around 1660, the cabinet is a highly functional object as well as a beautiful one.  With all its hidden drawers and compartments, it served as, among other things, a safe deposit box, a medicine cabinet, and a jewelry box.  The nobleman or wealthy merchant who owned such a lavish cabinet would have invited fellow connoisseurs to explore its inner riches with him.  You can discover all the secrets of the interior virtually through the iPad in front of the case."""
Londonderry Vase,961.mp3,"""Narrator:  Napoleon Bonaparte rose to prominence as a general in the Revolutionary Army in France.  Proclaimed emperor in 1804, he commissioned this vase a year later from the famed porcelain factory at Sevres, outside Paris.  Its overblown grandiosity reflected the political ambitions of Napoleon, who would seize control of the French government after the French Revolution.  The Sevres factory, which had supplied spectacular porcelain pieces to the French court in the 18th century, had fallen on hard times during the Revolution.  Napoleon ordered its restoration so that it could provide equally impressive porcelain wares to the new Imperial aristocracy.  With its gilded and enameled decorations and strictly symmetrical neoclassical design, it exemplifies the imperial grandeur of the era.  The scroll-like handles were modeled after paintings on antique cases now identified as Classical period Greek.  Although work on the vase began in 1805, it took eight years to finish.  Meanwhile, Napoleon's fortunes declined.  Only after he was forced to abdicate in 1814 did this spectacular vase become the property of the state.  Louis XVIII, Napoleon's immediate successor, gave it away to the British foreign secretary, Viscount Castlereagh, ironically one of the leaders of the European coalition that brought down Napoleon."""
Relief of a Falling Warrior,963.mp3,"""Narrator:  During the Roman Empire, the educated citizens were great admirers of classical Greek art, so much so that they often copied or closely imitated great works of Greek art.  This Roman-era marble relief of a wounded warrior is modeled after a renowned Greek work made five to six centuries earlier in the 5th century B.C.  At that time, a similar image was featured as part of a monumental status of the Greek goddess Athena which stood at the Parthenon, the major temple overlooking Athens.  Athena held a shield decorated with multiple images, including a relief of a fallen warrior.  It was probably meant to honor the Athenian soldiers who gave their lives repelling Persian invaders in 480 B.C.  Our warrior was carved centuries later during the Roman Empire's ascendency in Athens, and resembles the relief on Athena's shield.  He sinks to the ground, his left hand clutching his shield while his right arm reaches toward the wound in his back.  His stoic expression and muscular form embody Greco-Roman ideals of bravery, virtue, and physical prowess.  In the Roman world, such sculptures reflected Roman collectors' cultural sophistication and refined knowledge of the Greek past.  Carved in Athens, the relief was no doubt intended for the villa of a wealthy Roman collector, perhaps even the emperor, Hadrian, who reigned during the 2nd century A.D., but the ship carrying it to Italy sank in the harbor of Athens's port, where it lay underwater until it was recovered in the 1920s.  In 1928, it was purchased for the Art Institute by Alfred Hamill, a Chicago banker who chaired the museum's committee on Egyptian and classical art."""
The Adoration of the Christ Child,965.mp3,"""Narrator:  The first thing you may notice about this early 16th century manger scene is how crowded it is.  Besides the holy family and the adoring shepherds, a multitude of half-naked, music-making angels have gathered to celebrate the miraculous birth of Christ, as related in the Gospel according to St. Luke.  This lively panel comes from the Amsterdam workshop of Jacob von Oostsanen.  It actually depicts two different moments in the Biblical narrative.  In the background, an angel in red hovers in the sky to announce the birth of Jesus to shepherds watching their flocks.  On the left, the shepherds are congregated around the Christ Child.  The setting shows both a humble wooden stable and what looks like the ruins of an elaborate palace.  The palace is probably a reference to the Gospel's tracing of Christ's ancestry back to the Old Testament's King David.  Throughout the panel there is evidence of subtle reworking by someone's hand, perhaps the artist himself.  What began as a linear, late Gothic-style picture was revised to bring a softer elegance to the holy figures.  One particularly charming detail that the x-ray studies have revealed is that that eyes of both mother and child were repainted.  They now appear to gaze directly at each other, a still center of intimacy amid the joyous celebration."""
Salome with the Head of Saint John the Baptist,966.mp3,"""Narrator:  Guido Reni was one of the greatest painters of 17th century Italy.  Here he depicts the moment when Salome first sees the severed head of John the Baptist, who has been decapitated at her request by King Herod.  At the time of this work, Reni's contemporaries were working in an overly expressive style defined by dramatic expressions, broad gestures, and bold contrasts between shadow and light, all characteristics of Baroque painting.  But Reni's approach to this horrifying moment is restrained.  We see the head on a platter remarkably free of blood and gore.  The expressions of Salome, her attendants, and the page holding the platter are subdued.  Certainly no one recoils from the grisly evidence.  Yet one contemporary remarked that the casual gesture with which Salome lifts the head by its hair, as if to get a better look, made his blood run cold.  Reni died in 1642 at age 67, not long after this picture was painted.  The entire scene is suffused with the cool pastel tones of Reni's later years.  Renowned for his luxuriant treatment of drapery and clothing, this work doesn't have the same high degree of finish he normally brought to his paintings, so the sketchy quality of certain areas, like the page's legs, has raised questions about whether Reni actually completed this painting.  On the other hand, it is this very sketchiness, the looseness and ease of Reni's brushstrokes, that strongly influenced later painters, such as the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, who worked in the late 18th and early 19th centuries."""
The Temptation of Saint Jerome,967.mp3,"""Narrator:  Giorgio Vasari is most recognized today for his compilation of biographies of Renaissance artists into the volume commonly known as ""Lives of the Artists"".  First published in 1550, it is one of the earliest works of art history, yet Vasari was also a prolific painter and architect.  Here he shows St. Jerome, who produced the enduring Latin translation of the Bible, meditating in the desert.  On the far right you can see the Bible, and below it a lion, which is St. Jerome's attribute, or the visual symbol used to identify him.  The saint focuses with intense devotion on a crucifix and beats himself with a rock to resist the temptations of the flesh symbolized by the figures of Venus and her attendants.  What's especially intriguing about this painting is that Vasari left it unfinished, and so we have a rare glimpse into his working methods.  You'll notice, for example, the traces of a grid he drew in black chalk over the whole surface.  This was to guide him in scaling up the composition from a smaller preliminary drawing.  There are also several areas such as the saint's right knee where Vasari has clearly tried several different positions.  None of this would have remained visible if Vasari had brought this painting to the same high degree of finish that characterizes his other pictures, including three other surviving versions of this composition.  We don't know why the picture wasn't completed.  Perhaps it was a commission that fell through, but there's something appealing to modern tastes in its lack of polish.  It's the way Vasari can be seen sketching experimentally with his brush instead of burying all evidence of his hand beneath smoothly applied layers of paint, which was a more common practice for artists during this period known as the Renaissance."""
The Watermill with the Great Red Roof,969.mp3,"""Narrator:  Edouard Manet is a pivotal figure in the development of modern art in the 19th century.  He often focused on the lives of contemporary Parisians, such as this woman, who stopped off at a café or brasserie for a mug of beer.  Elegantly dressed, she projects a self-sufficient air that would have struck contemporary viewers as fashionably, even provocatively, modern, an impression heightened by the fact that she's sitting alone.  Manet's quick, flickering brushstrokes mirror the fleetingness of the moment.  They're especially effective in rending the woman's face.  Rather than constructing her features in the careful manner of 19th century realism, Manet seems to be applying makeup to his model with quick dabs of color, the pink of her rouged cheeks and her red lipstick.  Despite the spontaneous look of the painting, Manet actually carefully sketched out the composition in an underdrawing before beginning to paint.  The illustrated magazine she holds may be a copy of La Vie Moderne, a trendy journal that covered literature, art, fashion, and society.  Its editors not only published Manet's drawings, they also exhibited some of his paintings, including this one in front of you, in the magazine's offices.  Manet's handling of paint and bold simplification of details influenced a generation of younger artists who created the style known as Impressionism.  This work, with its bright colors, fluid surfaces, and even looser brushstrokes, was completed in 1880, three years before Manet's death.  It shows how, in his later years, the Impressionists, in turn, influenced him.  ""Woman Reading"" was one of the last acquisitions made by Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn, the wife of a prominent Chicago attorney.  She began collecting art after her husband's death in 1910 and filled the rooms of her apartment at the Blackstone Hotel with her treasures.  She died in 1932, bequeathing her collection of important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works to the museum."""

Water Lilies,970.mp3,"""Narrator:  Claude Monet was a remarkably prolific artist.  He was incredibly responsive to the changes in nature and creates series of paintings which showed the effects of air and light on landscapes, such as in stacks of wheat and water lilies, both on view in this gallery.  This ""Water Lilies"" is one of a series of some 80 paintings he made between 1903 and 1909, inspired by the pond at his home in Giverny, about 50 miles northwest of Paris.  It's said that he destroyed as many as 30 canvasses, because they didn't meet his exacting standards, before exhibiting the rest of the series at a Paris gallery.  Certainly this picture shows the artist at the top of his game.  Notice all the different surface textures.  With a variety of rapid but deft brushstrokes, he creates the thickly painted pink flowers, the thinner greens of the tree branches, and the reflections in the aquamarine water.  Without a horizon line, we seem to hover over the scene, not unlike the way the lilies float on the surface of the pond and the surface of the image.  Unlike a more traditional horizontal landscape, the square format of this painting and the expansive water at the center keeps our eyes moving around the periphery, like the rim of a wheel around a hub.  This picture came from the collection of Martin Ryerson, one of the Art Institute's earliest trustees and most generous donors.  For the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, he leant paintings to the Palace of Fine Art's exhibition.  This world's fair was a milestone in Chicago's cultural evolution, an opportunity for the city to show itself at its best on a global stage.  The fair also introduced many Chicago collectors to the works of Claude Monet and the other Impressionists."""
Near the Lake,971.mp3,"""Narrator:  Along with Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir is considered one of the masters of Impressionism, a style that sought to capture light and movement through bold combinations of colors applied in a rapid volley of brushstrokes.  In ""Near the Lake"", Renoir is experimenting with a slightly different approach.  Instead of unifying his picture with an overall sense of atmospheric light, he varies his brushstrokes to suit the subject at hand-- longer, horizontal strokes for the sparkling water in the background; shorter, vertical strokes for the hanging vines; and thinner marks, in a kind of hatching pattern, to bring out textures in the clothing.  Renoir's focus on the leisure activities of the middle class, as opposed to the wealthy, is one hallmark of Impressionism.  The casually dressed man at the left wears the banded straw hat of an amateur boatman.  For his companion, Renoir posed a 21-year-old seamstress named Aline Charigot, who soon became his mistress, and then his wife, and the mother of his three children.  ""Near the Lake"" was a gift to the museum from Bertha Palmer, a Chicago socialite who, with her husband, financier Potter Palmer, became an enthusiastic collector of modern art.  In 1891 alone, she bought 25 paintings by Monet, whom she had met in Paris.  Another friend of Mrs. Palmer's was the American painter Mary Cassatt.  As an expatriate member of the Impressionist circle, Cassatt guided the Palmers and other Americans in their purchases of modern art.  In 1893, Mrs. Palmer was the head of the Board of Lady Managers at the World's Columbian Exposition, an event that gave many Chicagoans their first exposure to Impressionism."""
Song of the Lark,972.mp3,"""Narrator:  ""The Song of the Lark"" by Jules Breton was one of the first pictures to enter the museum's collection when we opened our original building in December 1893.  The painting depicts a peasant girl who, beginning her day in the fields, stops to listen to the morning bird's song.  It was often featured in museum publications and quickly became one of the most popular of our early collection.  Reproductions of the painting were often found in schoolbooks and hanging on classroom walls across America in the 1920s and '30s.  References even appeared in two popular coming-of-age novels, Willa Cather's ""Song of the Lark"", which takes its title from the painting, and Thomas Wolfe's ""Look Homeward, Angel"".  In both stories, the talented yet poor and culturally naïve protagonists find the painting inspirational.  What made this scene of a barefoot French peasant so popular?  Breton, a conservative French artist of the late 19th century, made this painting at a time when French peasants were deserting the countryside to work in urban centers and mechanized equipment was replacing the simple farming implements of old.  In short, Breton's painting is a nostalgic nod to a vanishing past, a sentimentalized depiction of what in reality had been back-breaking work.  As tastes changed, the popularity of Breton's work did not always align with the values of the museum's professional staff.  In fact, during Chicago's 1933 World's Fair, the artistic merit of ""The Song of the Lark"" was hotly debated.  Even though Robert Harshe, the Art Institute's director at the time, expressed his disapproval of the painting, it was voted the most popular painting in America in a Chicago newspaper poll.  The results were announced at the museum by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  The painting came to the Art Institute as part of a generous gift of 41 paintings donated by Marshall Field's sister-in-law in memory of her late husband."""
Nighthawks,973.mp3,"""Narrator:  Edward Hopper said he based ""Nighthawks"" on a diner in New York's Greenwich Village, where he lived for 54 years.  Despite many attempts to find the original building, it's not a literal depiction of any one specific place.  Hopper has radically simplified the setting to heighten the overwhelming mood of loneliness and isolation.  The street outside is totally deserted, with not even a trace of litter to suggest that anyone has ever passed by, and no door to the diner is visible.  It's as if the four people inside are trapped inside a fishbowl.  Two patrons stare straight ahead.  Through apparently together, they seem to have nothing to share with each other, or with the hunched-over third patron.  Hopper was an avid moviegoer, and ""Nighthawks"" has the feel of a scene from a 1940s film noir.  Such films took their subject matter and alienated characters from crime stories by writers like Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain.  In many of these stories, the action takes place in diners and bars.  Fluorescent lighting was still new in the 1940s, and Hopper has captured the essence of its cool, unflattering glow.  Together, the alienated diners, their lack of interaction, and the greenish tint of the painting convey a sense of loneliness and suggest the difficulty of making connections in the modern urban world.  The Art Institute purchased this painting directly from the artist in 1942 after it had been seen in the museum's annual exhibition of American art that spring.  Now it is one of the most recognized American paintings of all time."""
Cow's Skull with Calico Roses,974.mp3,"""Narrator:  Georgia O'Keeffe painted ""Cow's Skull with Calico Roses"" in 1931.  She presents the skull against a flattened background of what looked like graying papers, which part to reveal a ribbon of black.  The sharp contrast only heightens the dead white of the bones.  A year earlier, Georgia O'Keeffe had begun collecting skeletons of animals that perished during a drought in the American Southwest.  She wrote of the bones scattered across the desert, ""They are as beautiful as anything I know.""  The handmade calico cloth flowers enhance the funereal symbolism.  They are used in the Southwest to decorate graves.  At the same time, I find there is nothing morbid or gruesome about this stark image.  Rather, stripped of ephemeral flesh, the timeless beauty of nature confronts us head-on.  Georgia O'Keeffe was born in Wisconsin in 1887.  In her late teens, she studied at the school of the Art Institute of Chicago.  Her abstract charcoal drawings captured the attention of Alfred Stieglitz, whose New York gallery was at the center of the modern art movement in America.  O'Keeffe and Stieglitz eventually wed, and although they often pursued separate lives professionals and personally, they remained married until Stieglitz's death.  O'Keeffe met and befriended Daniel Catton Rich, director of the Art Institute from 1936 to 1958, on one of his trips to New Mexico.  Through their friendship, she donated many of the important works of art that Alfred Stieglitz had collected.  Among them were a number of her own paintings, including this one."""
"The Advance-Guard, or The Military Sacrifice (The Ambush)",975.mp3,"""Narrator:  George F. Harding, the Chicago businessman and political powerbroker, was an avid art collector.  Along with his fabled collection of arms and armor, now in the museum's collection, he favored the works of Frederic Remington, an artist who romanticized the American West as an arena for manly deeds and actions.  ""The Advance Guard"" was painted to illustrate an article Remington himself wrote in the magazine Harper's Weekly.  In it he described the armed struggled against Native Americans on the Western frontier.  The painting shows the moment when an advance scout for a U.S. cavalry patrol has been shot by an Indian sniper.  You can even see a thin stream of blood on the horse's flank.  Though no enemies can be seen, combat is implied by the harsh landscape that provides cover for an ambush.  The painting's subtitle, ""The Military Sacrifice"", refers to a soldier giving his life for his comrades.  With this selfless action, the advance scout has ensured the safety of the remaining troops.  By 1890, when Remington painted this scene, the Wild West he evoked was already receding into myth.  Five years earlier, Chief Sitting Bull, a veteran of the Great Sioux War and the Battle of Little Bighorn, had gone from fighting against American expansion to appearing in Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, which even included theatrical reenactments of battles with Native Americans.  By promoting an idealized image of this vanished era as a paradigm for contemporary life, Remington became rich and famous."""
Tall Clock,976.mp3,"""Narrator:  This 1912 clock is a splendid example of interior design of the Prairie School, a style that was a Midwestern variant on designs favored by the English Arts and Crafts movement, which shunned excessive ornamentation in favor of geometric patterns.  The rectangular severity of the mahogany case, with its thin strips of brass inlay, is enlivened by a pierced panel of curving, plantlike forms.  The geometric wood extensions, or finials, atop the case may have been inspired by Japanese temple architecture.  The most famous practitioner of the Prairie School style was the Chicagoan Frank Lloyd Wright, who wanted a purely new American architecture free of Old Europe.  His colleague, architect George Grant Elmslie, designed this tall clock for the Henry Babson House in Riverside, Illinois, just a few miles outside the city limits of Chicago.  The only imported parts of this clock are the German-made chimes.  Everything else was made in the United States.  In keeping with the architect-designed objects, this clock was intended not only for a specific house, but for a specific place in that house.  The house has since been demolished, but pictures in a magazine published in 1915 showed that the clock stood near a fireplace of similar design, which contained the Elmslie-designed andirons, or firedogs, also on display in this gallery."""
Excavation,977.mp3,"""Narrator:  This painting, now acclaimed as one of Willem de Kooning's masterpieces, won the Logan Medal and Purchase Prize in the 60th Annual American Exhibition at the Art Institute in 1951.  Normally handed out to more conventional works of art, the award was a surprise and caused quite an uproar.  Critics objected to what they considered the work's extreme abstraction.  This is somewhat ironic, since de Kooning, although considered a leading member of the Abstract Expressionist movement, said a year before the acquisition, ""I'm not interested in abstracting or taking things out.  I paint this way because I can keep putting more and more things in-- drama, anger, pain, love, a figure, a horse, my ideas about space.""  What emerged in this painting is a dynamic interplay between abstraction and representation that is a hallmark of de Kooning's mature art.  As your gaze roams around the canvas, you can identify parts of human anatomy-- noses, eyes, teeth, necks and jaws, as well as birds, fish, and other animals.  De Kooning worked on this canvas for eight months and his process is visible.  He added shapes, tracing outlines on paper so he could see what a form looked like somewhere else in a different position.  He painted over what he'd done, scraped paint away, added some more.  Nothing is stable; everything is in flux.  ""Excavation"" is impressive and grand, a monument to the trial-and-error process of self-discovery that went into its creation.  At this time in his life, the artist enjoyed roaming New York City at night, and he would often peer through holes cut in the wooden fences that surrounded construction sites.  Perhaps these nocturnal rambles inspired the title.  At the upper left is a rare but telling gestures-- two lines of white paint squeezed directly from the tube, a kind of homage to Jackson Pollack's drip paintings that had attracted widespread attention the year before.  The Art Institute acquired the painting in 1952, continuing its commitment to collecting works of avant-garde art. """
